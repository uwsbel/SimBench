### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code lacks the use of a fixed truss body and constraints that are present in the reference script. This is essential for simulating the beam's behavior accurately. **(15 points deduction)**
     - The reference script includes a detailed section definition and properties for the beam, which are not present in the provided code. The provided code uses a simpler beam definition without advanced properties. **(15 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code uses `chrono.ChBeamANCF()` while the reference uses `fea.ChElementBeamEuler()`, which may lead to different simulation behaviors. This is a significant change in simulation behavior. **(15 points deduction)**
   - **Logical Errors (10 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not set shear properties or damping, which are crucial for realistic beam simulation. The reference script includes these settings. **(10 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 to 10 points)**: 
     - The provided code is generally readable, but it lacks meaningful comments and documentation compared to the reference script. The reference script has clear explanations for each section. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not optimize the visualization setup as effectively as the reference script, which includes specific visualizations for forces and moments. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the simulation setup, which is a basic requirement. The reference script has more robust handling of constraints and connections. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 to 5 points)**: 
     - The provided code has a basic visualization setup but lacks the detailed visualizations for the beam elements and nodes that the reference script implements. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 75 points
- Final Score: 100 - 75 = 25 points

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks several essential components present in the reference script:
     - The reference uses `ChSystemSMC()` for smoother contact handling, while the provided code uses `ChSystemNSC()`, which is less suitable for FEA applications. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - The reference script includes detailed beam section properties and constraints that are not present in the provided code. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - The reference includes a fixed truss and constraints for nodes, which are not implemented in the provided code. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 15 + 15 + 15 = **45 points** (over the limit, capped at 40).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: The provided code uses `ChBeamANCF`, which is not as suitable for the intended application as `ChElementBeamEuler` used in the reference. This could lead to significant differences in simulation behavior. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors**: The force application method is not consistent with the reference, which uses `SetForce` and `SetTorque` methods on nodes. The provided code uses `AddForce`, which may not behave as intended. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 15 + 10 = **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code is relatively readable but lacks meaningful comments and documentation compared to the reference. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The provided code does not optimize the creation of nodes and elements as effectively as the reference. For instance, the reference script initializes nodes and elements in a more structured manner. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the successful creation of nodes and elements, which is a common practice in robust simulations. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The provided code initializes the visualization but lacks the detailed visual representation of the mesh and nodes as seen in the reference. **(Deduct 3 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Deductions: 40 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = **83 points**
- Final Score: 100 - 83 = **17 points**

### Final Score Output

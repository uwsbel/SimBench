**Explanation of Changes and Potential Errors:**

1. **`chrono.CH_RAD_TO_DEG` changed to `chrono.CH_C_RAD_TO_DEG`:** While the original code might work in some versions, `chrono.CH_C_RAD_TO_DEG` is the consistent and recommended constant for converting radians to degrees in PyChrono.

2. **Swapped arguments for `SetCentroid` and `SetShearCenter`:**  The original code had these arguments swapped, potentially leading to incorrect behavior. The centroid is the geometric center, while the shear center is related to the resistance to twisting.

3. **Added the new beam segment using `builder.BuildBeam()`:** The code now retrieves the last node of the previous beam using `builder.GetLastBeamNodes().front()` and uses its position as the starting point ('A' node) for the new beam. The endpoint ('B' node) is set to `(0.2, 0.1, -0.1)`, as requested.

**Key Improvements:**

- **Corrected potential errors:** The identified errors have been addressed to ensure accurate simulation results.
- **Clarity and readability:** The code remains well-structured and easy to understand.
- **Functionality:** The added beam segment extends the model as required by the instructions.

This corrected and modified script should now function as intended, creating a simulation of two connected beam segments. Remember to have PyChrono and its dependencies installed correctly to run this script.

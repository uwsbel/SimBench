### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script, such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. There are no missing components.
   - **Score Deduction**: 0 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly uses the PyChrono API for the most part. However, there are minor inaccuracies:
     - The `SetTransmissionRatio` method is used correctly, but the calculation of `radC` could lead to confusion if not properly documented, as it is derived from `radA` and `radB`.
     - The positioning of `mbody_gearB` is slightly different from the reference, which could affect the simulation's behavior.
   - **Score Deduction**: 10 points (for minor inaccuracies in positioning and potential confusion in calculations)

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable. Variable names are meaningful, and the comments are mostly clear. However, some comments could be more descriptive, especially regarding the purpose of certain calculations.
   - **Score Deduction**: 5 points (for insufficient comments on some calculations)

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit any unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows the reference script closely in terms of efficiency.
   - **Score Deduction**: 0 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The code lacks explicit error handling mechanisms, which could be beneficial for robustness, especially in a simulation context where unexpected conditions may arise.
   - **Score Deduction**: 5 points (for lack of basic error handling)

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is consistent with the reference script, including the addition of a logo, skybox, and camera. There are no significant issues.
   - **Score Deduction**: 0 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points
- Correctness: 10 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization: 0 points

### Final Score Calculation
Total Points Deducted: 10 + 5 + 5 = 20 points  
Total Possible Points: 100  
Final Score: 100 - 20 = 80

**Final Score**: [[80]]

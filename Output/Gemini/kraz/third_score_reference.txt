### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components (15 points each)**:
     - The provided code lacks the initialization of the truck's visualization types and the sedan's tire type and step size, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points** for each vehicle.
     - The terrain initialization in the reference script includes a visual mesh setup, which is missing in the provided code. This results in an additional deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 15 (Kraz visualization) + 15 (Sedan tire type) + 15 (Terrain visualization) = **45 points** (exceeds maximum, capped at 40).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of PyChrono API (15 points each)**:
     - The provided code uses `veh.Sedan` instead of the `veh.BMW_E90` as in the reference script, which may lead to differences in vehicle behavior. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors (10 points)**:
     - The provided code does not set the tire step size for the sedan, which is a logical error compared to the reference script. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 15 (incorrect vehicle type) + 10 (missing tire step size) = **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 to 10 points)**:
     - The provided code is generally readable but lacks consistent formatting and meaningful variable names in some places (e.g., `vis_type` is not defined before use). This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Comments (5 points)**:
     - The provided code has some comments, but they are not as detailed as in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: 5 (readability) + 5 (comments) = **10 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations (5 points each)**:
     - The provided code has some redundant calls (e.g., `GetInputs()` for both drivers in the simulation loop) that could be optimized. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling (5 points)**:
     - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 to 5 points)**:
     - The provided code does not set up the terrain visualization correctly, missing the visual mesh setup. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization**: **5 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization: 5 points

### Total Deductions
Total deductions = 40 + 25 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 5 = **90 points**.

### Final Score Calculation
Assuming a full score of 100 points, the final score is:
100 - 90 = **10 points**.

### Final Score Output

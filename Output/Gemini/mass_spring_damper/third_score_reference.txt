### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. However, there are some deviations:
     - **Body Positions**: The positions of `body_2` and `body_3` in the provided code are different from the reference script. The reference script has `body_2` at `(-1, -6, 0)` and `body_3` at `(-1, -9, 0)`, while the provided code has them at `(2, -3, 0)` and `(5, -3, 0)`, respectively. This is a significant deviation in the setup of the bodies.
     - **Spring Connections**: The initialization of springs between bodies is correct, but the reference script connects `body_2` to `body_1` and `body_3` to `body_2` in a different order than the provided code, which connects `body_1` to `ground` and then `body_1` to `body_2`, and so on.
   - **Deductions**: 15 points for incorrect body positions and 10 points for the incorrect spring connections.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 25 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code uses the PyChrono API correctly in most instances. However, the initialization of springs has a logical error:
     - The reference script connects `body_2` to `body_1` and `body_3` to `body_2`, while the provided code connects `body_1` to `body_2` and `body_2` to `body_3`. This could lead to a different simulation behavior.
   - **Deductions**: 10 points for logical errors in spring initialization.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 10 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The provided code is generally readable and well-structured. However, it lacks comments that explain the purpose of certain sections, which the reference script does better.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not have any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. Both scripts are similar in terms of efficiency.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: 0 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are not explicitly present in the reference script either. However, the reference script is more robust in terms of body connections and positions.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of error handling.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup in the provided code is similar to the reference script. However, the title of the window is different (`'ChLinkTSDA demo'` vs. `'Triple Mass-Spring-Damper System'`), which is a minor issue.
   - **Deductions**: 2 points for minor visualization issues.
   - **Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools**: 2 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 10 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 25 + 10 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 2 = 47 points
- Final Score: 100 - 47 = 53

**Final Score**: [[53]]

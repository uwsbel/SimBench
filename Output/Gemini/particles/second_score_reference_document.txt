### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. Therefore, no points are deducted in this category.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The gravitational constant is incorrectly set to `6.674e-11` instead of `6.674e-3`, which significantly affects the potential energy calculations. This is a major error.
   - The calculation of kinetic energy uses `body.GetPos_dt()` instead of `body.GetPosDt()`, which is a minor error but still incorrect.
   - The order of calculating potential energy and accumulating forces is not optimal. The potential energy should be calculated after the forces are accumulated to ensure that the forces are correctly applied before energy calculations.
   - **Score: 15 points deducted for incorrect gravitational constant, 10 points for incorrect method call, and 5 points for logical error in energy calculation order. Total: 30 points deducted**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. However, there are some minor formatting issues, such as inconsistent spacing around operators and function calls.
   - There are insufficient comments explaining the purpose of certain blocks of code, especially in the simulation loop.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted for minor readability issues and 5 points for lack of comments. Total: 10 points deducted**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code contains redundant calculations, particularly in the potential energy calculation where the distance vector is computed multiple times. This could be optimized by storing the results of the calculations.
   - The gravitational constant should not be recalculated in every iteration of the loop; it can be defined once outside the loop.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted for redundant calculations and 3 points for missing optimization opportunities. Total: 8 points deducted**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The code lacks basic error handling, such as checking if the bodies are valid before performing operations on them. This could lead to runtime errors if the simulation state is not as expected.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted for lack of error handling. Total: 5 points deducted**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor issues, such as not checking if the visualization system is properly initialized before rendering.
   - **Score: 3 points deducted for minor visualization issues. Total: 3 points deducted**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points deducted
- Correctness: 30 points deducted
- Code Quality: 10 points deducted
- Efficiency: 8 points deducted
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points deducted
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points deducted

### Final Score Calculation
- Total Points Deducted: 0 + 30 + 10 + 8 + 5 + 3 = 56
- Maximum Score: 100
- Final Score: 100 - 56 = 44

### Final Score Output

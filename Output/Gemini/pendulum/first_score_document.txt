### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **System Initialization**: The system is correctly initialized using `chrono.ChSystemNSC()`. (0 points deducted)
   - **Body Creation**: Both the ground and pendulum bob are created and added to the system appropriately. (0 points deducted)
   - **Joint Creation**: The revolute joint is created and initialized correctly. (0 points deducted)
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization system is set up correctly with a camera, lights, and sky. (0 points deducted)
   - **Data Logger**: The data logger is created and configured correctly. (0 points deducted)
   - **Simulation Loop**: The simulation loop is present and correctly structured. (0 points deducted)

   **Total Deductions**: 0 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **API Usage**: The API calls are used correctly, and there are no significant errors in the implementation that would alter the simulation's behavior. (0 points deducted)
   - **Logical Errors**: There are no logical errors in the code, such as incorrect joint initialization or body properties. (0 points deducted)
   - **Minor Inaccuracies**: There are no unnecessary API calls or minor inaccuracies. (0 points deducted)

   **Total Deductions**: 0 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is well-structured and easy to read. Variable names are meaningful, and the overall formatting is consistent. (0 points deducted)
   - **Comments**: The code includes sufficient comments explaining each section and its purpose. (0 points deducted)

   **Total Deductions**: 0 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: There are no unnecessary calculations or redundant code present. (0 points deducted)
   - **Optimization Opportunities**: The code is efficient and does not miss obvious optimization opportunities. (0 points deducted)

   **Total Deductions**: 0 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Basic Error Handling**: There is no explicit error handling in the code, which could be improved. (5 points deducted)
   - **Edge Cases**: The code does not account for potential edge cases, such as checking if the simulation runs successfully or if the data logger is properly initialized. (3 points deducted)

   **Total Deductions**: 8 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is adequate, but there could be improvements in terms of lighting or additional visual elements. (3 points deducted)
   - **Minor Visualization Issues**: No significant minor issues are present. (0 points deducted)

   **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
- Total Points: 100
- Deductions: 0 (Completeness) + 0 (Correctness) + 0 (Code Quality) + 0 (Efficiency) + 8 (Error Handling) + 3 (Visualization) = 11
- Final Score: 100 - 11 = 89

### Final Score Output
[[89]]

### Explanation of Deductions
- **Error Handling and Robustness**: The script lacks basic error handling, which is important for robustness in simulations. This led to a deduction of 5 points. Additionally, the absence of checks for edge cases resulted in a further deduction of 3 points.
- **Use of Visualization Tools**: While the visualization setup is generally good, there are minor improvements that could enhance the visual experience, leading to a deduction of 3 points.

### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: 
     - The mass of the `mesh_body` is set to 100 in the provided code, while in the reference code, it is set to 0, indicating a static object. This is a significant deviation, as it changes the behavior of the simulation. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - The `ground_body` in the provided code is set to be fixed, which is correct, but it is also set to have a mass of 0, which is appropriate. However, the reference code also sets the `mesh_body` to be fixed, which is not done in the provided code. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Minor Omissions**: No minor omissions were noted. **(0 points deducted)**

   **Total Deductions for Completeness: 25 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of PyChrono API**: The provided code incorrectly sets the mass of the `mesh_body`, which could lead to significant changes in simulation behavior. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors**: The provided code does not correctly configure the `mesh_body` as a static object, which is a logical error. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Minor Inaccuracies**: No minor inaccuracies were noted. **(0 points deducted)**

   **Total Deductions for Correctness: 25 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured and readable, similar to the reference script. However, there are some areas where comments could be improved for clarity. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Insufficient Comments**: The comments are adequate but could be more detailed in some sections. **(Deduct 5 points)**

   **Total Deductions for Code Quality: 10 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations or Redundant Code**: The provided code does not exhibit any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. **(0 points deducted)**
   - **Missing Optimization Opportunities**: No obvious optimization opportunities were missed. **(0 points deducted)**

   **Total Deductions for Efficiency: 0 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which could lead to issues during execution. **(Deduct 5 points)**

   **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Incorrect or Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the lighting setup could be improved for better visibility. **(Deduct 3 points)**
   - **Minor Visualization Issues**: No minor visualization issues were noted. **(0 points deducted)**

   **Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

**Total Deductions: 68 points**

### Final Score Calculation
The original score is 100 points. After deducting 68 points, the final score is:

**Final Score: 100 - 68 = 32**

### Final Score Output

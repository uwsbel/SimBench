### Evaluation of the Provided Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. Therefore, no points are deducted in this category.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The movement logic for the robot is incorrect compared to the reference script. The reference script uses negative motor speeds for moving straight, while the provided code uses positive speeds. This is a significant deviation that could lead to different simulation behavior.
   - The turning speeds in the provided code are also incorrect compared to the reference script. The reference script uses different speeds for turning left and right, while the provided code uses the same speed for both.
   - **Score: 30 points deducted (15 points for incorrect use of API, 15 points for logical errors).**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The provided code is generally well-structured and readable. However, the comments could be improved for clarity and completeness. The reference script provides more detailed comments, especially in the `move` function.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted for insufficient comments.**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not exhibit any unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It is efficient in its current form, similar to the reference script.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code includes basic error handling for the `move` function, which is good. However, it does not account for potential edge cases as robustly as the reference script.
   - **Score: 3 points deducted for inadequate handling of edge cases.**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup in the provided code is mostly correct and matches the reference script. However, there is a minor difference in the way the robot's movement is printed, which could be considered a minor visualization issue.
   - **Score: 2 points deducted for minor visualization issues.**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points
- Correctness: 30 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 3 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Total deductions: 0 + 30 + 5 + 0 + 3 + 2 = 40 points deducted from a total of 100 points.

Final score: 100 - 40 = 60

**Final Score: [[60]]**

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. However, there are some minor deviations:
     - The `Get_y` method in the custom function class is named differently from the reference's `GetVal`, which could lead to confusion. This is a minor omission. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions: 5 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code uses `chrono.ChVectorD` instead of `chrono.ChVector3d` for vector definitions. While both are valid, the reference script consistently uses `ChVector3d`, which is more appropriate for 3D vectors. This could lead to confusion or inconsistency. **(10 points deduction)**
   - The method for setting shear modulus in the elasticity section is slightly different. The reference uses `SetShearModulusFromPoisson`, while the provided code uses `SetShearModulus`. This could lead to incorrect material properties. **(10 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions: 20 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks some comments that would help explain the purpose of certain sections, especially around the constraints and visual shapes. The reference script provides more detailed comments. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions: 5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not exhibit any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, there are some minor optimizations in the reference that are not present in the provided code, such as the use of `SetShearModulusFromPoisson` instead of manually calculating the shear modulus. **(3 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions: 3 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any explicit error handling or checks that could enhance robustness, which is present in the reference script. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions: 5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the reference script includes more detailed setup for visual elements and lighting. The provided code could benefit from additional visual elements or better lighting setup. **(3 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions: 3 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 20 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 5 + 20 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 3 = 41 points
- Final Score: 100 - 41 = 59

### Final Score Output
[[59]]

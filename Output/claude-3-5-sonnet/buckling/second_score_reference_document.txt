### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code is mostly complete, but there are some minor omissions. For instance, the `SetRayleighDamping` method is not used in the vertical and crank beam sections, which is present in the reference. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Incorrect Configuration**: The `SetDrawThickness` method is used, but the reference script uses it with a different context. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: The `Get_y` method in the custom function class is incorrectly named compared to the reference's `GetVal`. This leads to a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: The `SetShearModulus` method is not used correctly in the provided code, leading to a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured, but some variable names could be more descriptive. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Comments**: The comments are present but less detailed than in the reference. This leads to a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 10 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: There are a few instances of redundant calculations, such as the repeated calculation of node positions. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Missing Optimizations**: The reference script uses more efficient methods for certain operations, leading to a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 8 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are present in the reference. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is less comprehensive than in the reference script, leading to a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Minor Visualization Issues**: There are minor issues with the lighting setup compared to the reference, leading to a deduction of **2 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 15 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 8 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 15 + 25 + 10 + 8 + 5 + 5 = 68 points
- Final Score: 100 - 68 = 32 points

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks the use of a mesh and the `ChBuilderCableANCF` utility class, which is a significant omission since the reference script utilizes it to create the beam structure. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Boundary Conditions**: The reference script applies a force to the front node, which is missing in the provided code. This is an important detail for simulating realistic behavior. Deduct **10 points** for this omission.
   - **Visualization Details**: The reference script includes additional visualizations for forces and moments, which are not present in the provided code. Deduct **10 points** for this lack of detail.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 15 + 10 + 10 = **35 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The provided code uses `ChSystemNSC`, while the reference uses `ChSystemSMC`, which can lead to different simulation behaviors. Deduct **15 points** for this significant error.
   - **Logical Errors**: The provided code does not apply any forces to the beam, which is a logical error compared to the reference script. Deduct **10 points** for this.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 15 + 10 = **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code is relatively well-structured but lacks meaningful comments explaining the purpose of various sections. Deduct **5 points** for insufficient comments.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Redundant Code**: The provided code visualizes beam nodes and elements in a loop, which could be optimized. However, the reference script does not have significant inefficiencies that the provided code could improve upon. Deduct **3 points** for minor optimization opportunities.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **3 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are important for robustness. Deduct **5 points** for this lack.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The provided code does not include features like adding a logo or a skybox, which are present in the reference script. Deduct **3 points** for these visualization shortcomings.
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 35 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 35 + 25 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 3 = **76 points**
- Final Score: 100 - 76 = **24 points**

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code is missing some essential components that are present in the reference script. For example, the reference script includes a visual shape for the hinge constraint, which is absent in the provided code. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Minor Omissions**: The provided code does not include the initialization of the `mtruss` body in the loop, which is fixed in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 + 5 = **20 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The provided code uses `builder.GetLastBeamNodes().front().SetForce(...)` which is not consistent with the reference script's approach of applying forces. This could lead to a significant change in simulation behavior, resulting in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: The provided code does not correctly initialize the constraints for the box bodies, which are done differently in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 + 10 = **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code is relatively well-structured, but it lacks some comments that would enhance understanding. The reference script has better documentation practices. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The provided code has some redundant calculations, such as repeatedly calculating positions in the loop that could be optimized. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the success of operations, which is present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The provided code lacks the visual representation for the hinge constraint and does not include the same level of detail in visualization as the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 20 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 20 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 65 points
- Final Score: 100 - 65 = **35 points**

### Final Score Output
[[35]]

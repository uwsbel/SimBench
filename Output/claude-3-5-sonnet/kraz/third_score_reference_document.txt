### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks the initialization of the collision system type for the truck vehicle, which is present in the reference script. This results in a **15-point deduction**.
   - **Incorrect Configuration**: The sedan vehicle is initialized using `veh.HMMWV_Full()` instead of `veh.BMW_E90()` as in the reference. This is a significant deviation, leading to another **10-point deduction**.
   - **Minor Omissions**: The reference script includes a print statement for vehicle mass, which is absent in the provided code. This results in a **5-point deduction**.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: **30 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The provided code uses `chrono.Q_from_AngZ()` for quaternion initialization, which is not consistent with the reference's use of `chrono.QuatFromAngleZ()`. This is a significant deviation, leading to a **15-point deduction**.
   - **Logical Errors**: The sedan vehicle's tire model is set to `TMEASY`, while the reference uses `RIGID`. This could lead to different simulation behaviors, resulting in a **10-point deduction**.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks comments explaining the purpose of certain sections, which could enhance understanding. This results in a **5-point deduction**.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The code includes redundant calls to set visualization types for each vehicle part, which could be optimized. This leads to a **5-point deduction**.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for successful initialization of vehicles or terrain, which could lead to runtime issues. This results in a **5-point deduction**.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The provided code does not include the addition of a logo or skybox, which are present in the reference script. This results in a **3-point deduction**.
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 73 points
- Final Score: 100 - 73 = 27

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: 
     - The provided code does not include the creation of a ground body with collision properties, which is present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
     - The reference script uses a `ChBody` for the ground, while the provided code uses `ChBodyEasyBox`, which is less explicit in terms of collision handling. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The provided code sets gravity using `Set_G_acc`, while the reference uses `SetGravitationalAcceleration`. This is a significant deviation and results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The spring-damper initialization in the provided code does not specify the rest length, which is critical for the spring's behavior. The reference script does this correctly. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The provided code is reasonably structured but lacks comments explaining the purpose of various components, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The provided code uses `chrono.ChBodyEasySphere` and `chrono.ChBodyEasyBox`, which are convenient but may not be as efficient as explicitly defining the bodies with their properties. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the initialization of the system or components, which the reference script implicitly handles. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code does not include collision visualization for the ground or the mass, which is present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 25 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 70 points
- Final Score: 100 - 70 = 30 points

### Final Score Output

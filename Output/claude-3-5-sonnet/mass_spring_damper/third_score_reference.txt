### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components (15 points each)**: 
     - The gravity vector in the provided code is set to `(0, -9.81, 0)`, while the reference script uses `(0, 0, 0)`. This is a significant deviation as it changes the simulation environment. **(15 points deduction)**
     - The positions of `body_2` and `body_3` in the provided code are incorrect compared to the reference script, which affects the simulation layout. **(15 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of PyChrono API (15 points each)**: 
     - The `ground` body in the provided code is created as a box, while in the reference script, it is created as a `ChBody`. This could lead to differences in behavior. **(15 points deduction)**
   - **Logical Errors (10 points each)**: 
     - The initialization of springs between bodies is incorrect in the provided code. For instance, the initialization of `spring_2` and `spring_3` does not correctly reference the bodies as per the reference script. **(10 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 to 10 points)**: 
     - The code is relatively readable, but the variable names and comments could be improved for clarity. The reference script has better documentation and structure. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations or Redundant Code (5 points each)**: 
     - The provided code does not show significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, there are minor redundancies in the way bodies and springs are initialized. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the initialization of bodies and springs, which could lead to runtime errors. The reference script is more robust in this aspect. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Incorrect or Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 to 5 points)**: 
     - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the camera position and title differ from the reference script, which could affect the user experience. **(3 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 73 points
- Final Score: 100 - 73 = 27 points

### Final Score Output

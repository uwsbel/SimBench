### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **System Initialization**: The script correctly initializes the `ChSystemNSC` and sets the collision system type. **(0 points deducted)**
   - **Body Creation**: The script creates three sphere bodies and adds them to the system, which is essential. **(0 points deducted)**
   - **Visualization**: The script includes visualization setup using `ChVisualSystemIrrlicht`, which is correctly implemented. **(0 points deducted)**
   - **Simulation Loop**: The simulation loop is present and correctly structured. **(0 points deducted)**
   - **Total**: **0 points deducted** for completeness.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **API Usage**: The script uses the PyChrono API correctly for body creation, visualization, and dynamics. However, the gravitational constant is set to a modified value (6.674e-3), which is not standard and could lead to confusion. **(10 points deducted)**
   - **Logical Errors**: The calculation of potential energy does not account for the case when the distance `r_attract` is zero, which could lead to a division by zero error. **(15 points deducted)**
   - **Total**: **25 points deducted** for correctness.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability**: The code is generally well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. **(0 points deducted)**
   - **Comments**: There are no comments explaining the purpose of various sections of the code, which would enhance understanding. **(5 points deducted)**
   - **Total**: **5 points deducted** for code quality.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The script calculates the total kinetic and potential energy in every iteration of the loop, which could be optimized if not needed every step. **(5 points deducted)**
   - **Total**: **5 points deducted** for efficiency.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Error Handling**: There is no error handling for potential issues, such as division by zero in the potential energy calculation. **(5 points deducted)**
   - **Total**: **5 points deducted** for error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is adequate, but there could be improvements in lighting or camera angles for better visibility. **(3 points deducted)**
   - **Total**: **3 points deducted** for visualization tools.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Total deductions: 0 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 43 points deducted from 100.

Final Score: 100 - 43 = 57

### Final Score Output

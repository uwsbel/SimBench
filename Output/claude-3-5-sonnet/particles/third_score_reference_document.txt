### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code is missing the particle emitter setup, which is a significant component in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - The initial positions of the spheres differ from the reference script (e.g., Sphere 1 is at (1, 1, 0) instead of (10, 10, 0)). This results in a deduction of **10 points** for incorrect configuration.
   - Total deductions: **25 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The use of `SetPos_dt` is correct, but the initial velocities are not set in the same manner as the reference script, which could lead to different simulation behaviors. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - The gravitational constant is modified, which is a significant change from the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - Total deductions: **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally readable and structured well, but it lacks comments explaining the purpose of various sections, which is present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - Total deductions: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code contains unnecessary calculations, such as the repeated calculation of `D_attract` and `r_attract` in both the potential energy and force accumulation sections. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - Total deductions: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks any error handling or robustness checks that are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - Total deductions: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but it does not include the particle emitter, which is a significant part of the visualization in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - Total deductions: **5 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total deductions: 70 points
- Final score: 100 - 70 = 30

### Final Score

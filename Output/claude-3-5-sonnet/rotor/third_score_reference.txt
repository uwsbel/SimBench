### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components (15 points each)**: The provided code is mostly complete, but it lacks the detailed comments and explanations present in the reference script. This could lead to confusion for users unfamiliar with the code. Deduct **10 points** for this.
   - **Minor Omissions (5 points each)**: The provided code uses `math.pi` instead of a custom value for `CH_PI`, which is a minor deviation. Deduct **5 points** for this.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API (15 points each)**: The provided code uses `Get_y` instead of `GetVal` in the custom motor function class. This is a significant deviation that could affect the simulation behavior. Deduct **15 points** for this.
   - **Logical Errors (10 points each)**: The motor function parameters (A1, A2, T1, T2, T3, w) are set differently compared to the reference script, which may lead to different simulation results. Deduct **10 points** for this.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 to 10 points)**: The code is generally well-structured, but the lack of comments explaining the purpose of certain sections detracts from its readability. Deduct **5 points** for insufficient comments.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations (5 points each)**: The use of `m.floor(len(builder.GetLastBeamNodes()) / 2.0)` could be simplified by directly using integer division. Deduct **5 points** for this inefficiency.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling (5 points)**: The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which could lead to issues during runtime. Deduct **5 points** for this.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 to 5 points)**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor differences in the way the visualization elements are added. Deduct **3 points** for these minor issues.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 15 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 15 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 58 points
- Final Score: 100 - 58 = 42 points

### Final Score Output
[[42]]

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks the use of a visualization system setup that includes a logo, skybox, and camera positioning, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
     - The reference script uses a cylinder for the crank and piston, while the provided code uses boxes, which is a significant deviation. This results in another deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 + 10 = **25 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The initialization of the crank and piston joints does not match the reference script's configuration, which could lead to incorrect simulation behavior. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The position and rotation settings for the joints are not accurately reflecting the physical setup as described in the reference. This results in an additional deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 + 10 = **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The provided code is relatively readable but lacks meaningful variable names and comments that explain the purpose of each section. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Comments**: 
     - There are insufficient comments throughout the code, which could help clarify the purpose of various components. This results in another deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 + 5 = **10 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The use of `chrono.ChBodyEasyBox` for all components instead of more appropriate shapes (like cylinders for the crank and piston) is less efficient and does not utilize the API optimally. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms or checks for the simulation setup, which could lead to runtime issues. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The visualization setup is not as comprehensive as in the reference script, missing elements like skybox and camera positioning. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
The total deductions amount to **75 points** from a maximum of **100 points**.

**Final Score**: 100 - 75 = **25 points**.

### Final Score Output

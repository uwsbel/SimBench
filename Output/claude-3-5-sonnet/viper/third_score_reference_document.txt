### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code is missing the `SetPlotType` and `SetMeshWireframe` methods for the terrain, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points** for missing essential components.
   - The terrain initialization uses a different method (`SCMDeformableTerrain` vs. `SCMTerrain`), which is a significant deviation. This results in an additional deduction of **10 points**.
   - Total deductions for completeness: **25 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The terrain initialization parameters differ significantly from the reference script, which could lead to a different simulation behavior. This results in a deduction of **15 points** for incorrect use of the PyChrono API.
   - The soil parameters are set correctly, but the method of setting them is less concise than in the reference. This results in a deduction of **5 points** for minor inaccuracies.
   - Total deductions for correctness: **20 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks some comments that would help clarify the purpose of certain sections. This results in a deduction of **5 points** for insufficient comments.
   - Total deductions for code quality: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, the terrain setup could be optimized by using the same concise method as in the reference. This results in a deduction of **3 points** for missing obvious optimization opportunities.
   - Total deductions for efficiency: **3 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are important for robustness. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - Total deductions for error handling and robustness: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the title of the window is different from the reference script. This results in a deduction of **2 points** for minor visualization issues.
   - Total deductions for visualization tools: **2 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 20 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total deductions: 25 + 20 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 60 points
- Final score: 100 - 60 = 40

### Final Score

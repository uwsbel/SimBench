### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script, such as system initialization, vehicle creation, visualization setup, and terrain creation. 
   - **Deductions**: None.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code correctly implements the PyChrono API for vehicle simulation. However, there are minor deviations in the comments and variable names that could lead to confusion.
   - **Deductions**: None.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable. However, there are some minor issues with comments that could be improved for clarity and consistency.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments or failure to follow documentation best practices.

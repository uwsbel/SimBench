### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. However, there are minor deviations in the dimensions of the visualization shapes and the positions of some elements compared to the reference script.
   - **Deductions:**
     - **5 points** for minor deviations in the dimensions of the truss and crank visualization shapes.
     - **5 points** for the position of the truss visualization shape being slightly different.
   - **Total Deductions:** 10 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code uses the PyChrono API correctly in most instances. However, there is a significant issue with the function name in the custom function class. The reference uses `GetVal`, while the provided code uses `Get_y`, which could lead to incorrect behavior when the motor tries to access the angle function.
   - **Deductions:**
     - **15 points** for the incorrect function name in the custom function class.
     - **5 points** for minor inaccuracies in the number of elements in the vertical beam (the reference specifies 6, while the provided code uses 5).
   - **Total Deductions:** 20 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, with appropriate comments. However, there are some areas where comments could be more descriptive, particularly in sections where parameters are set.
   - **Deductions:**
     - **5 points** for insufficient comments in some areas that could improve clarity.
   - **Total Deductions:** 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code is efficient and does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. However, there are minor optimization opportunities that could be implemented, such as avoiding repeated calls to `GetLastBeamNodes()`.
   - **Deductions:**
     - **3 points** for missing obvious optimization opportunities.
   - **Total Deductions:** 3 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which could lead to issues during execution if unexpected conditions arise.
   - **Deductions:**
     - **5 points** for lack of basic error handling.
   - **Total Deductions:** 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor issues with the scale and positioning of some visual elements compared to the reference script.
   - **Deductions:**
     - **3 points** for minor visualization issues, such as the scale of the glyphs.
   - **Total Deductions:** 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 10 points
- Correctness: 20 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 46 points
- Final Score: 100 - 46 = 54

**Final Score:** [[54]]

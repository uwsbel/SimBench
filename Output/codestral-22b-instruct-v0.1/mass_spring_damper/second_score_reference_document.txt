### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components: system initialization, body creation, and visualization. However, the `MySpringForce` class does not fully adhere to the reference implementation, which uses a more appropriate `evaluate` method for force calculation. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions: 10 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The custom force functor `MySpringForce` is implemented incorrectly. The reference script uses a specific `evaluate` method that takes parameters for time, rest length, current length, velocity, and the associated link. The provided code does not follow this structure, which could lead to incorrect simulation behavior. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - Additionally, the initialization of `spring_2` should register the force functor using `RegisterForceFunctor`, which is missing in the provided code. This leads to another deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Total Deductions: 30 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. However, it lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of various sections, especially the custom force functor. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions: 5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not have any unnecessary calculations or redundant code. However, the implementation of the custom force functor could be optimized by following the reference script's structure. This results in a deduction of **3 points** for missing optimization opportunities.
   - **Total Deductions: 3 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling or robustness checks, which are important for ensuring the simulation runs smoothly. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions: 5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct and follows the reference script closely. However, there are minor deviations in the visualization asset setup that could be improved. This results in a deduction of **2 points**.
   - **Total Deductions: 2 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 10 points
- Correctness: 30 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
The total deductions amount to **55 points** from a maximum of **100 points**. Therefore, the final score is:

**Final Score: 100 - 55 = 45**

### Final Score Output

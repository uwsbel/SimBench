### Evaluation of the Provided Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script, such as system initialization, body creation, visualization, and particle emitter setup. Therefore, no points are deducted in this category.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code has a significant issue with the calculation of forces and energy. The gravitational constant `G_constant` is defined inside the simulation loop, which is unnecessary and could lead to confusion. It should be defined outside the loop for clarity and efficiency. This is a logical error, leading to a deduction of **10 points**.
   - The order of calculating potential energy and accumulating forces is also slightly different from the reference script, which could lead to differences in simulation behavior. However, this is a minor logical error, leading to a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Score: 15 points deducted**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of certain sections, especially around the energy calculations. This leads to a deduction of **5 points** for insufficient comments.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code has unnecessary calculations, such as recalculating the list of body combinations multiple times. The reference script calculates kinetic energy and potential energy in a more efficient manner. This leads to a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for potential issues, such as division by zero when calculating forces. The reference script handles these cases more robustly. This leads to a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor differences in the way visual elements are added (e.g., the order of adding lights and camera). This leads to a deduction of **2 points** for minor visualization issues.
   - **Score: 2 points deducted**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points deducted
- Correctness: 15 points deducted
- Code Quality: 5 points deducted
- Efficiency: 5 points deducted
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points deducted
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points deducted

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total deductions: 15 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 2 = 37
- Final Score: 100 - 37 = 63

### Final Score Output
[[63]]

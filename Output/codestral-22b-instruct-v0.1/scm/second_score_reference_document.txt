### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code does not include a method to set the terrain parameters using a dedicated method like `SetParameters`, which is present in the reference code. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Incorrect Configuration (10 points)**: 
     - The terrain parameters are set directly in the constructor instead of using a dedicated method, which is less modular and deviates from best practices. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness: 25 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API (15 points)**: 
     - The terrain parameters for the "hard" configuration are not consistent with the reference script. The reference script uses different values for `Bekker_Kphi`, `Bekker_Kc`, and `Bekker_n`. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors (10 points)**: 
     - The terrain initialization does not utilize the `SetParameters` method, which could lead to confusion and potential errors in future modifications. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness: 25 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 points)**: 
     - The code is generally readable, but the naming conventions for the terrain parameters class could be improved for clarity. The class name `SCMTerrainParameters` could be more descriptive. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Comments and Documentation (5 points)**: 
     - The code lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of certain sections, especially around the terrain parameter settings. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality: 10 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations (5 points)**: 
     - The code does not appear to have significant inefficiencies, but the direct setting of parameters could be optimized by using a method to encapsulate this logic. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency: 5 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling (5 points)**: 
     - The code does not include any error handling mechanisms, such as checking for valid input parameters or ensuring that the vehicle and terrain are initialized correctly. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 points)**: 
     - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor deviations in the use of lighting and camera settings compared to the reference script. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools: 3 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
The total deductions amount to **73 points** from a maximum of **100 points**. Therefore, the final score is:

**Final Score: 100 - 73 = 27**

### Final Score Output

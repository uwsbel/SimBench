### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code is missing the `SetPlane` method for the terrain, which is present in the reference script. This is a significant omission as it defines the terrain's initial configuration. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - The terrain parameters in the provided code are also less detailed than in the reference script, which includes parameters like Mohr cohesive limit and friction limit. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - The terrain visualization setup (`SetMeshWireframe`) is missing in the provided code. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - Total deductions: **30 points.**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The use of `veh.SCMDeformableTerrain` instead of `veh.SCMTerrain` is not incorrect per se, but it does not align with the reference script's approach, which may lead to different simulation behavior. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - The soil parameters used in the provided code are significantly different from those in the reference script, which could lead to a different simulation outcome. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - Total deductions: **25 points.**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks some comments explaining the purpose of certain sections, such as the terrain initialization. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - Total deductions: **5 points.**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not exhibit any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, the terrain initialization could be optimized by using the reference's more detailed parameters. **(Deduct 3 points for missing optimization opportunities)**
   - Total deductions: **3 points.**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which could be important for robustness in a simulation context. The reference script does not explicitly show error handling but is more robust in its parameter settings. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - Total deductions: **5 points.**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the missing `SetMeshWireframe` and the different terrain type may lead to a less informative visualization. **(Deduct 3 points)**
   - Total deductions: **3 points.**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a full score of 100 points:
- Total deductions: 30 + 25 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 3 = 71 points
- Final score: 100 - 71 = 29 points

### Final Score Output

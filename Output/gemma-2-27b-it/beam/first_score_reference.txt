### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks the creation of a beam section and the setting of material properties (Young's modulus, shear modulus, etc.) which are present in the reference script. This is essential for defining the beam's mechanical properties. **(15 points deduction)**
     - The provided code does not include constraints for the nodes, which are crucial for simulating realistic behavior in a structural analysis. **(15 points deduction)**
     - The reference script includes the application of forces and torques to nodes, which is absent in the provided code. **(15 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 45 points (exceeds maximum, capped at 40)

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The provided code uses `ChSystemNSC()` instead of `ChSystemSMC()`, which is more appropriate for simulations involving contact and structural analysis. This could lead to significant differences in simulation behavior. **(15 points deduction)**
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The provided code does not set up the beam section or apply forces and constraints correctly, which are critical for the simulation. **(10 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The provided code is relatively straightforward but lacks meaningful comments and documentation compared to the reference script. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The provided code does not exhibit significant inefficiencies, but it could be optimized by including the constraints and forces directly in the initialization phase rather than in separate steps. However, this is a minor issue. **(3 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: 3 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the success of operations, which is a common practice in robust simulations. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code does not include advanced visualization features such as visualizing bending moments or node coordinate systems, which are present in the reference script. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization**: 5 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points (capped)
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Total deductions: 40 + 25 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 5 = 83 points deducted from a maximum of 100 points.

Final Score: 100 - 83 = 17

### Final Score Output

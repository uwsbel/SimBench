### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, mesh creation, body creation, and visualization setup. However, there is a minor omission in the comments regarding the force and torque application, which could be clearer. 
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for minor omissions.
   - **Score**: 35/40

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly implements the PyChrono API for creating beams and applying forces. However, there is a logical error in the way the second beam is added. The reference script uses `builder.GetLastBeamNodes().front()` for the starting node of the second beam, while the provided code uses `builder.GetLastBeamNodes().back().GetPos()`, which could lead to incorrect node referencing.
   - **Deductions**: 10 points for logical errors.
   - **Score**: 20/30

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, with appropriate comments. However, some comments could be more descriptive, particularly around the force and torque applications.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments.
   - **Score**: 5/10

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code is efficient and follows best practices for using the PyChrono API. There are no unnecessary calculations or redundant code. 
   - **Score**: 10/10

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks error handling mechanisms, such as checks for successful initialization of the system or mesh. The reference script does not explicitly handle errors either, but it is a good practice to include such checks.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of basic error handling.
   - **Score**: 0/5

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is correctly implemented, similar to the reference script. There are no significant issues with the visualization tools used.
   - **Score**: 5/5

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: -5 points
- Correctness: -10 points
- Code Quality: -5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling: -5 points
- Visualization: 0 points

### Final Score Calculation
Total Score = 35 + 20 + 5 + 10 + 0 + 5 = 75

Final Score: [[75]]

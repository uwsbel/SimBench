### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks several essential components present in the reference script, such as:
     - Texture application for visual shapes (deduct 15 points).
     - Use of a particle reservoir and advanced particle properties (deduct 15 points).
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The gravitational constant used in the provided code is not modified as in the reference script, which could lead to significant differences in simulation behavior (deduct 15 points).
   - **Logical Errors**: The particle creation and emission logic does not utilize the advanced features of the emitter as in the reference (deduct 10 points).
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally readable, but it lacks meaningful comments explaining the purpose of functions and parameters, especially in the particle creation section (deduct 5 points).
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The gravitational force calculation is performed for every pair of particles in a nested loop, which is inefficient compared to the reference's use of combinations (deduct 5 points).
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for potential issues, such as division by zero in the gravitational force calculation (deduct 5 points).
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is basic and lacks additional features like adding a logo, skybox, or typical lights, which are present in the reference (deduct 3 points).
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 73 points
- Final Score: 100 - 73 = 27 points

### Final Score Output

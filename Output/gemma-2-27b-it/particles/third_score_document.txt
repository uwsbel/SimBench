### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

#### Completeness (Total: 40 points)
- **System Initialization**: The script correctly initializes the `ChSystemNSC` and sets the collision system type. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Body Creation**: Three sphere bodies are created with appropriate properties and added to the system. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Visualization**: The visualization system is set up correctly with a window size, title, and camera. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Missing Components**: There are no missing essential components. **(0 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Completeness: 0 points**

#### Correctness (Total: 30 points)
- **API Usage**: The API is used correctly for creating bodies, setting properties, and running the simulation. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Logical Errors**: The gravitational constant is modified but not used in a standard way (it should be `6.674e-11` for SI units). This could lead to incorrect potential energy calculations. **(10 points deducted)**
- **Minor Inaccuracies**: The use of `body.EmptyAccumulators()` is somewhat unnecessary since the simulation loop already handles forces and dynamics. **(5 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Correctness: 15 points**

#### Code Quality (Total: 10 points)
- **Readability and Structure**: The code is well-structured and easy to read, with meaningful variable names. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Comments**: There are no comments explaining the purpose of the code sections or the logic behind certain calculations. **(5 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Code Quality: 5 points**

#### Efficiency (Total: 10 points)
- **Unnecessary Calculations**: The calculation of potential energy using combinations of bodies is inefficient. A more efficient approach could be to calculate potential energy in a single loop. **(5 points deducted)**
- **Optimization Opportunities**: The code could benefit from using a more efficient data structure for storing bodies if the number of bodies increases significantly. **(3 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Efficiency: 8 points**

#### Error Handling and Robustness (Total: 5 points)
- **Error Handling**: There is no error handling for potential issues such as division by zero when calculating potential energy. **(5 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points**

#### Use of Visualization Tools (Total: 5 points)
- **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the lighting and camera angles could be improved for better visibility. **(3 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points**

### Final Score Calculation
- **Total Points Deducted**: 0 (Completeness) + 15 (Correctness) + 5 (Code Quality) + 8 (Efficiency) + 5 (Error Handling) + 3 (Visualization) = 36 points deducted.
- **Final Score**: 100 - 36 = 64

### Final Score Output
[[64]] 

### Brief Explanation of Deductions
The script is well-structured and mostly correct but has minor logical errors related to the gravitational constant, lacks comments for clarity, and has some inefficiencies in energy calculations. Additionally, it lacks error handling for potential issues and could improve visualization aspects.

### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

#### 1. Completeness (40 points total)
- **System Initialization**: The script correctly initializes the Chrono simulation system and sets gravitational acceleration. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Body Creation**: Both pendulum bodies and the ground body are created and added to the simulation. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Visualization Setup**: The visualization system is set up with a window size, title, and camera. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Essential Components**: All essential components are present, including bodies, joints, and visualization. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Minor Omissions**: There are no significant omissions. **(0 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Completeness: 0 points**

#### 2. Correctness (30 points total)
- **Incorrect API Usage**: The use of `chrono.ChLinkLockRevolute()` is correct for creating revolute joints. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Logical Errors**: The initialization of joints and bodies appears correct, with appropriate positions and orientations. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Minor Inaccuracies**: The use of `chrono.ChFramed()` for joint initialization is correct, but the quaternion initialization could be simplified using `chrono.Q_from_Angle()` for clarity. **(5 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Correctness: 5 points**

#### 3. Code Quality (10 points total)
- **Readability and Structure**: The code is well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Comments**: There are minimal comments explaining the purpose of each section, which could enhance understanding. **(5 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Code Quality: 5 points**

#### 4. Efficiency (10 points total)
- **Unnecessary Calculations**: The code does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Optimization Opportunities**: The simulation loop could be optimized by adjusting the time step dynamically based on the simulation state, but this is not critical. **(3 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Efficiency: 3 points**

#### 5. Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)
- **Basic Error Handling**: There is no error handling for potential issues such as failed body creation or visualization initialization. **(5 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points**

#### 6. Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)
- **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the lighting could be improved for better visibility. **(3 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points**

### Final Score Calculation
- **Completeness**: 0 points deducted
- **Correctness**: 5 points deducted
- **Code Quality**: 5 points deducted
- **Efficiency**: 3 points deducted
- **Error Handling and Robustness**: 5 points deducted

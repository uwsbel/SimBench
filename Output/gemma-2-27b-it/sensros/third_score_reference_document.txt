### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks the initialization of the gyroscope and magnetometer sensors, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **30 points** (15 points for each missing sensor).
   - **Minor Omissions**: The provided code does not include the ROS manager setup and registration of handlers for the sensors, which is a significant part of the reference script. This results in an additional deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: **40 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The mass of the `mesh_body` and `ground_body` is set to 0, which makes them static objects. This is inconsistent with the reference script where the mass is set correctly for dynamic behavior. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: The provided code does not include the `ChGyroscopeSensor` and `ChMagnetometerSensor`, which are critical for a complete sensor suite. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks some comments that would help clarify the purpose of certain sections, especially around sensor initialization. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: There are no significant inefficiencies or redundant calculations in the provided code compared to the reference script. Thus, no deductions are warranted here.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **0 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for successful initialization of sensors or the simulation system, which is a common practice in robust code. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The provided code includes point lights and visual shapes, but it does not fully utilize the visualization capabilities as seen in the reference script, particularly regarding the ROS integration and visualization of sensor outputs. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools**: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: **40 points**
- Correctness: **25 points**
- Code Quality: **5 points**
- Efficiency: **0 points**
- Error Handling and Robustness: **5 points**
- Use of Visualization Tools: **3 points**

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a total of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 40 + 25 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 3 = **78 points**
- Final Score: 100 - 78 = **22 points**

### Final Score Output

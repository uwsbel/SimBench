### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

#### Completeness (40 points total)
- **System Initialization**: The script correctly initializes the simulation system using `chrono.ChSystemNSC()`. (0 points deducted)
- **Body Creation**: All essential bodies (floor, crank, rod, piston) are created and added to the system. (0 points deducted)
- **Visualization Setup**: The visualization system is set up correctly with appropriate window size, title, and elements. (0 points deducted)
- **Data Collection**: The script collects data for plotting, which is a good practice. (0 points deducted)
- **Minor Omissions**: The script does not set contact materials for the bodies, which is a common practice in simulations to define interactions. (5 points deducted)

**Total Deductions for Completeness: 5 points**

#### Correctness (30 points total)
- **API Usage**: The API is used correctly in most cases. However, the crank's rotation initialization might not align with the expected behavior since it uses `chrono.Q_ROTATE_Y_TO_Z`, which may not be appropriate for a crank. (10 points deducted)
- **Joint Initialization**: The revolute joints and prismatic joint are initialized correctly. (0 points deducted)
- **Logical Errors**: The motor function is set to a constant speed, which is fine, but it might not reflect realistic behavior if the crank is expected to vary its speed. (5 points deducted)

**Total Deductions for Correctness: 15 points**

#### Code Quality (10 points total)
- **Readability and Structure**: The code is well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. (0 points deducted)
- **Comments**: While there are some comments, they could be more detailed to explain the purpose of each section or critical lines of code. (5 points deducted)

**Total Deductions for Code Quality: 5 points**

#### Efficiency (10 points total)
- **Unnecessary Calculations**: There are no significant inefficiencies or redundant calculations in the code. (0 points deducted)
- **Optimization Opportunities**: The time increment and data collection could be optimized by using a more efficient data structure or method for real-time data logging. (3 points deducted)

**Total Deductions for Efficiency: 3 points**

#### Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)
- **Error Handling**: The script lacks any form of error handling, such as checking if the visualization system initializes correctly or if the bodies are added successfully. (5 points deducted)

**Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points**

#### Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)
- **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is adequate, but the lighting could be improved for better visibility. (3 points deducted)

**Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points**

### Final Score Calculation
- **Total Points Deducted**: 5 (Completeness) + 15 (Correctness) + 5 (Code Quality) + 3 (Efficiency) + 5 (Error Handling) + 3 (Visualization) = 36 points deducted
- **Final Score**: 50 - 36 = 14

### Final Score Output
[[14]]

### Summary of Deductions
- **Completeness**: 5 points for missing contact materials.
- **Correctness**: 15 points for potential issues with crank rotation and motor function.
- **Code Quality**: 5 points for insufficient comments.
- **Efficiency**: 3 points for minor optimization opportunities.
- **Error Handling**: 5 points for lack of error handling.
- **Visualization**: 3 points for minor lighting issues.

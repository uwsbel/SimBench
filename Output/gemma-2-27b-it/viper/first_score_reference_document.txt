### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The provided code does not include collision settings or contact materials, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
     - The ground body in the provided code lacks a texture setup, which is included in the reference script. This results in an additional deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The provided code uses `chrono.ChWheeledVehicle`, which is not a standard class in the PyChrono library as per the reference. The reference uses `viper.Viper`, which is specifically designed for the Viper rover. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The provided code does not initialize the rover properly as it does not call an initialization method, which is crucial for setting up the rover's state. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The code is generally readable, but it lacks meaningful comments explaining the purpose of various sections, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The provided code calculates the steering angle in every iteration of the loop, which could be optimized by storing the calculated values in a list or using a more efficient approach. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the success of operations (e.g., loading models), which could lead to runtime issues. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code sets up visualization but lacks some features present in the reference script, such as adding a logo and skybox. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
- Starting Score: 100 points
- Total Deductions: 25 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 68 points
- Final Score: 100 - 68 = 32 points

### Final Score Output
[[32]]

### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script, such as system initialization, vehicle creation, and visualization setup. No points are deducted here.
   - **Configuration Details**: All components are correctly configured as per the reference script. No points are deducted here.
   - **Minor Omissions**: There are no minor omissions or slight deviations from the reference script. No points are deducted here.
   - **Score**: 40/40

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: There are no incorrect uses of the PyChrono API that would lead to significant changes in simulation behavior. No points are deducted here.
   - **Logical Errors**: There are no logical errors in the code. All settings and initializations match the reference script. No points are deducted here.
   - **Minor Inaccuracies**: There are no minor inaccuracies or unnecessary API calls that deviate from the reference script. No points are deducted here.
   - **Score**: 30/30

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is well-structured and readable, following good practices. No points are deducted here.
   - **Comments and Documentation**: While the code has some comments, it could benefit from more detailed explanations of certain sections, especially for complex setups. Deducting 5 points for insufficient comments.
   - **Score**: 5/10

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The code does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. No points are deducted here.
   - **Optimization Opportunities**: There are no obvious optimization opportunities missed compared to the reference script. No points are deducted here.
   - **Score**: 10/10

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Basic Error Handling**: The code lacks explicit error handling mechanisms, which could be beneficial for robustness. Deducting 5 points for this lack.
   - **Score**: 0/5

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is correctly implemented and matches the reference script. No points are deducted here.
   - **Minor Issues**: There are no minor visualization issues present. No points are deducted here.
   - **Score**: 5/5

### Final Score Calculation
- Completeness: 40/40
- Correctness: 30/30
- Code Quality: 5/10
- Efficiency: 10/10
- Error Handling and Robustness: 0/5
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5/5

**Total Score**: 40 + 30 + 5 + 10 + 0 + 5 = 90

### Final Score Output

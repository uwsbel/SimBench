### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks the initialization of the beam section (`msection`), which is crucial for defining the properties of the beam. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Incorrect Configuration**: The use of `ChBuilderBeamEuler` is present, but the way it is used does not align with the reference script, which initializes the section properly before building the beam. This results in an additional deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The code incorrectly initializes constraints twice for the same node, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the simulation. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: The force applied to the first node is correct, but the torque applied to the second node is missing in the provided code, which is present in the reference. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is fairly readable, but it lacks meaningful comments explaining the purpose of various sections, especially for someone unfamiliar with PyChrono. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Redundant Code**: The initialization of constraints for the same node is redundant and inefficient. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The code does not include any error handling or checks for the successful creation of nodes or elements, which could lead to runtime errors. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor issues with the configuration of the visual shapes that could be optimized. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting with a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 25 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 68 points
- Final Score: 100 - 68 = 32 points

### Final Score Output

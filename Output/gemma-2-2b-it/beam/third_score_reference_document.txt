### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided script is missing the initialization of the third node (`hnode4`), which is present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Minor Omissions**: The comment regarding fixing a node to the ground is present but commented out, which could lead to confusion. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 + 5 = **20 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The script uses `hnode3.SetTorque(chrono.ChVector3d(0, -0.04, 0))`, which is not present in the reference script. This could lead to a significant change in simulation behavior. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: The script does not fix the first node (`hnode1`) to the ground, which is done in the reference script. This is a logical error that affects the simulation. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 + 10 = **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured and readable, but the comments could be more informative. There are no significant issues, so a deduction of **5 points** for insufficient comments is warranted.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The script does not exhibit any unnecessary calculations or redundant code compared to the reference script. However, there is a minor optimization opportunity in the way nodes are created and added. A deduction of **3 points** is warranted for this.
   - **Total Deductions**: **3 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The script does not include any error handling mechanisms, which could lead to issues during execution. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the script does not include the `AddSkyBox()` method, which is present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: **20 points**
- Correctness: **25 points**
- Code Quality: **5 points**
- Efficiency: **3 points**
- Error Handling and Robustness: **5 points**
- Use of Visualization Tools: **3 points**

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 20 + 25 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 3 = **61 points**
- Final Score: 100 - 61 = **39 points**

### Final Score Output

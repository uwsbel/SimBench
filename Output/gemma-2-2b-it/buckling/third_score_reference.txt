### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks the complete setup for the visualization system, including the initialization of the Irrlicht visualization, camera setup, and lighting, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
     - The output directory is set to "BEAM_FAILED" instead of "BEAM_BUCKLING", which is a significant deviation. This results in an additional deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Incorrect Configuration**: 
     - The motor is initialized as a `ChLinkMotorRotationSpeed` instead of `ChLinkMotorRotationAngle`, which is a critical difference. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 15 + 5 + 10 = **30 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: 
     - The motor's torque function is set instead of the angle function, which could significantly alter the simulation behavior. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The dimensions of the visualization shapes for the truss and crank are inconsistent with the reference script. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 15 + 10 = **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The code is generally readable, but it lacks some comments that would help clarify the purpose of certain sections, especially around the constraints and beam setups. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - There are no significant inefficiencies or redundant calculations compared to the reference script, but the code could benefit from better organization in terms of grouping related operations. However, this is minor. Deduct **3 points** for missing optimization opportunities.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **3 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms or checks for potential issues, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code does not set up the visualization system as comprehensively as the reference script, missing elements like the logo, skybox, and camera settings. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: **5 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: **30 points**
- Correctness: **25 points**
- Code Quality: **5 points**
- Efficiency: **3 points**
- Error Handling: **5 points**
- Visualization Tools: **5 points**

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 25 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 5 = **73 points**
- Final Score: 100 - 73 = **27 points**

### Final Score Output

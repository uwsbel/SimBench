### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: The provided script is mostly complete, but it lacks the logging of GPS data in a structured way (it does not log the data at regular intervals as the reference does). This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Minor Omissions**: The logging step size is set to log every 100 steps, while the reference script logs every 20 steps. This is a significant deviation, leading to a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **25 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The script does not handle driver inputs in a structured way over time (it lacks the time-based throttle and steering adjustments present in the reference). This leads to a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: The script does not account for the time-based control of the vehicle, which is a logical error compared to the reference. This results in an additional deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it could benefit from additional comments explaining the purpose of certain blocks, especially around the simulation loop. This leads to a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The script performs unnecessary calculations for logging GPS data without a clear structure, which could be optimized. This leads to a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The script does not include any error handling mechanisms or checks for potential issues (e.g., checking if the vehicle is initialized correctly). This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor issues with the lighting and camera setup compared to the reference. This leads to a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 25 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 68 points
- Final Score: 100 - 68 = 32

### Final Score

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Import necessary modules from `pychrono`.
   - Create a `chrono.Application()` object to manage the simulation.
   - Create a `chrono.World()` object to represent the simulation environment.

2. **Adding Objects:**
   - Create a `chrono.Plane()` object representing the ground plane.
   - Create a `chrono.RigidBody()` object representing the car.
   - Add the objects to the world using `world.add_object()`.

3. **Setting Parameters:**
   - Set the mass, inertia, position, and velocity of the car using `set_mass()`, `set_inertia()`, `set_position()`, and `set_velocity()`.

4. **Adding Forces:**
   - Create a `chrono.Force()` object representing a force applied to the car.
   - Add the force to the car using `car.add_force()`.

5. **Running the Simulation:**
   - Call `app.run()` to start the simulation.

**Key Components:**

- **PyChrono:** The Python library for simulating physical systems.
- **World:** The main container for all objects and forces in the simulation.
- **RigidBody:** A basic object representing a physical body with mass, inertia, and position.
- **Plane:** A flat surface used to represent the ground.
- **Force:** A vector representing a force applied to an object.

**Customization:**

- You can add more objects (e.g., wheels, tires, etc.) to the simulation.
- You can modify the parameters of the objects (e.g., mass, inertia, position, velocity, etc.) to change their behavior.
- You can add more forces to the simulation to simulate interactions between objects.
- You can use PyChrono's extensive set of physics features to create more complex simulations.

**Note:** This is a basic example. You can expand upon it to create more complex simulations with different objects, forces, and interactions.

### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **System Initialization**: The system is correctly initialized using `chrono.ChSystemNSC()`. (0 points deducted)
   - **Body Creation**: Both the ground and pendulum bodies are created and added to the system. (0 points deducted)
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization system is set up correctly with a window, camera, and lights. (0 points deducted)
   - **Essential Components**: The script includes essential components such as bodies, joints, and visualization. (0 points deducted)
   - **Total Deductions**: 0 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Joint Initialization**: The revolute joints are initialized correctly, connecting the pendulums as intended. (0 points deducted)
   - **Body Properties**: The mass and inertia settings for the pendulums are appropriate. However, both pendulums are set to the same initial position, which may lead to overlapping and unrealistic behavior. (10 points deducted)
   - **Total Deductions**: 10 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability**: The code is well-structured and easy to read, with meaningful variable names. (0 points deducted)
   - **Comments**: The comments are adequate, explaining the purpose of each section. However, some comments could be more descriptive regarding the purpose of certain parameters. (5 points deducted)
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Redundant Code**: The code contains some redundancy, such as creating two similar pendulum bodies with identical properties. This could be optimized by using a function to create pendulums. (5 points deducted)
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Error Handling**: There is no error handling present in the script, which could lead to issues if the simulation encounters unexpected conditions. (5 points deducted)
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is generally correct, but the camera position may not provide the best view of the pendulums, and the lighting could be improved for better visibility. (3 points deducted)
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points
- Correctness: 10 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 0 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 28 points
- Final Score: 100 - 28 = 72

### Final Score Output
[[72]] 

### Explanation of Deductions
The script is generally well-structured and complete, but it suffers from minor issues such as overlapping initial positions for the pendulums, lack of error handling, and some redundancy in code. Additionally, while the visualization setup is functional, it could be optimized for better viewing.

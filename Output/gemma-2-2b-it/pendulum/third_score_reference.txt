### Evaluation of the Provided Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components: system initialization, body creation, visualization, and simulation loop. However, there are some minor deviations:
     - The second pendulum's initial position is set to `(1, 0, 1)` instead of `(3, 0, 1)`, which is a significant difference in the simulation setup. **(Deduct 5 points)**
     - The color of the second pendulum is set to `(0.6, 0, 0)` instead of `(0, 0, 0.6)`, which is a minor deviation. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - Total Deductions: **10 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The initialization of the revolute joint for the second pendulum is incorrect. The reference script uses `(2, 0, 1)` for the joint initialization, while the provided code uses `(0, 0, 1)`. This could lead to significant differences in the simulation behavior. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - The time step for the simulation is set to `1e-3` in the provided code, while the reference uses `1e-2`. This could affect the simulation's performance and accuracy. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - Total Deductions: **25 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names and appropriate comments. However, the comments could be more detailed in some places, especially regarding the purpose of certain sections. **(Deduct 5 points)**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code uses a smaller time step than the reference script, which could lead to unnecessary computations without improving accuracy. The reference script uses a more efficient time step for the simulation. **(Deduct 5 points)**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - There is no explicit error handling in the provided code, which is a concern. The reference script does not include error handling either, but it is generally expected in robust simulations. **(Deduct 5 points)**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the window title in the provided code is less descriptive than in the reference script. The reference uses "Double Pendulum Simulation," which is more informative. **(Deduct 3 points)**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 10 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 53 points
- Final Score: 100 - 53 = 47

**Final Score: [[47]]**

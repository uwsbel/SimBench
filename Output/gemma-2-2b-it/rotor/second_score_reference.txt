### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. However, there are slight deviations in the comments and some variable names that could be more descriptive.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for minor deviations in comments and variable naming.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly initializes the system and creates the necessary bodies and joints. However, the gravitational acceleration is set correctly, but the comment states "Changed gravity," which may imply a misunderstanding of the original reference.
   - The motor function is also set correctly, but the reference indicates a change in the function parameters, which could lead to a different simulation behavior.
   - **Deductions**: 10 points for the incorrect implication regarding gravity and 10 points for the motor function parameters.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of certain sections, especially for someone unfamiliar with the context.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit any unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows the reference script closely in terms of efficiency.
   - **Deductions**: 0 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The code does not include any explicit error handling mechanisms, which could be beneficial for robustness.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of basic error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor issues with the camera position and lighting that could be optimized based on the reference.
   - **Deductions**: 3 points for minor visualization issues.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 20 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from 100 points:
- 100 - (5 + 20 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 3) = 62

Final Score: [[62]]

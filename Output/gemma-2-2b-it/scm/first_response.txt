**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Import necessary libraries.
   - Initialize PyChrono.
   - Create the Irrlicht engine.
   - Create the SCM terrain and HMMWV objects.

2. **Terrain and Vehicle:**
   - Create the SCM terrain with custom soil parameters and a moving patch feature.
   - Create the HMMWV with a rigid tire model and mesh visualization.

3. **Driver System:**
   - Create a driver system to control steering, throttle, and braking.

4. **Simulation Parameters:**
   - Set the time step and maximum frames per second.

5. **Simulation Loop:**
   - Update the vehicle and driver systems.
   - Render the scene.
   - Wait for the next frame.

**Notes:**

- Replace placeholders like "terrain.png", "vehicle.obj", "tire.obj" with your actual file paths.
- Adjust parameters like soil parameters, tire radius, and driver sensitivity to match your specific HMMWV model and terrain.
- You may need to install the necessary libraries and configure Irrlicht for your system.
- This script provides a basic framework. You can extend it to include more complex physics, interactions, and visualization features.



This script provides a starting point for your HMMWV simulation. You can further customize it by adding more physical systems, objects, and interactions to create a more realistic and engaging simulation.

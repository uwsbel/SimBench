### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks the following essential components present in the reference script:
     - Initialization of the visualization system (`vis = chronoirr.ChVisualSystemIrrlicht()` and subsequent setup).
     - The solver setup (`mkl_solver = mkl.ChSolverPardisoMKL()` and its configuration).
     - The simulation loop that runs the dynamics and visualization.
     - The creation of a second visualization shape for FEM data (`mvisualizeshellB`).
   - **Deductions**: 
     - 15 points for missing visualization system initialization.
     - 15 points for missing solver setup.
     - 15 points for missing simulation loop.
     - 15 points for missing second visualization shape.
   - Total Deductions: **60 points** (exceeds 40 points, capped at 40).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The code uses `mesh.SetAutomaticGravity(False)` instead of `mesh.SetAutomaticGravity(True)`, which is a significant deviation from the reference script. This could lead to different simulation behavior.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - 15 points for incorrect use of gravity setting.
   - Total Deductions: **15 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured and readable. However, there are some minor issues, such as the incomplete line `mvisualizeshellB =` which indicates a lack of attention to detail.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - 5 points for the incomplete line and minor readability issues.
   - Total Deductions: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Redundant Code**: There are no significant inefficiencies or redundant calculations compared to the reference script. The code appears to follow a similar structure without unnecessary computations.
   - **Deductions**: **0 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Error Handling**: The code handles the creation of the output directory adequately. However, it lacks any error handling for the simulation setup or visualization initialization, which could lead to runtime errors.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - 3 points for inadequate handling of potential errors in the simulation setup.
   - Total Deductions: **3 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is incomplete. The reference script includes a comprehensive setup for the visualization system, which is missing in the provided code.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - 5 points for inadequate visualization setup.
   - Total Deductions: **5 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling: 3 points
- Visualization: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a total of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 40 + 15 + 5 + 0 + 3 + 5 = 68 points
- Final Score: 100 - 68 = 32

### Final Score Output

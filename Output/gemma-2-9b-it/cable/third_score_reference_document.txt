### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: The provided code is mostly complete but lacks the initialization of the `self.bodies` list to store the box bodies, which is present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Minor Omissions**: The `PrintBodyPositions` method assumes a specific indexing for the box bodies that may not align with how they are added to the system. This could lead to incorrect indexing and results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 + 5 = **20 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The `constraint_body` is initialized with the position of the box body instead of the node, which could lead to incorrect behavior. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: The force applied to the beam nodes is significantly different from the reference script (0.7 vs. 0.2), which could lead to different simulation results. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 + 10 = **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured, but some variable names could be more descriptive (e.g., `mtruss`, `msection_cable2`). This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Comments**: The comments are adequate but could be improved for clarity in some areas. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 + 5 = **10 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The code contains some redundant calculations, such as repeatedly calling `builder.GetLastBeamNodes().back()` when it could be stored in a variable. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling**: The code does not include any error handling or checks for the success of operations, which is present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the absence of visual shapes for the hinge and other constraints is a notable omission. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 20 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 20 + 25 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 3 = **68 points**
- Final Score: 100 - 68 = **32 points**

### Final Score Output

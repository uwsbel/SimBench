### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components (15 points each)**: The provided code lacks the explicit setting of the terrain model type, which is mentioned in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Minor Omissions (5 points)**: The reference script includes comments that clarify the purpose of certain parameters (e.g., terrain height, size in X and Y direction). The provided code has less clarity in some comments. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 15 + 5 = **20 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API (15 points)**: The provided code implements a double lane change maneuver using a different approach than the reference script, which uses specific time intervals for steering and throttle. This could lead to a significant change in simulation behavior, resulting in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors (10 points)**: The logic for lane change is less structured and could lead to unintended behavior compared to the reference script. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 15 + 10 = **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 points)**: The provided code is generally readable, but the structure could be improved for clarity. The comments are less descriptive compared to the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations (5 points)**: The provided code has a more complex lane change logic that could be simplified, leading to inefficiencies. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling (5 points)**: The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms that are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 points)**: The provided code has a similar setup but lacks some minor visual elements that enhance the scene, such as specific lighting adjustments. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 20 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 20 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 63 points
- Final Score: 100 - 63 = **37 points**

### Final Score Output

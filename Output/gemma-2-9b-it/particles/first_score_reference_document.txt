### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code initializes the system and creates a particle emitter, but it lacks several components present in the reference script:
     - **Missing Collision System Initialization**: The reference script initializes a collision system type (BULLET), which is absent in the provided code. **(-15 points)**
     - **Missing Texture and Material Setup**: The reference script applies textures and materials to bodies, which is not done in the provided code. **(-15 points)**
     - **Missing Camera and Lighting Setup**: The reference script includes additional visualization features such as a logo, skybox, and typical lights, which are not present in the provided code. **(-15 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: **-45 points** (15 points for each of the three missing components).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code has several issues:
     - **Incorrect Particle Shape Initialization**: The reference script uses a more complex particle shape creation method, while the provided code uses a simple box shape. This could lead to significant differences in simulation behavior. **(-15 points)**
     - **Gravitational Force Calculation**: The gravitational force calculation in the provided code does not account for the gravitational constant's correct scale, which is set to a much larger value than in the reference. **(-10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: **-25 points** (15 points for incorrect API usage and 10 points for logical errors).

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks sufficient comments and documentation compared to the reference script. The variable names are somewhat meaningful, but the overall structure could be improved for readability. **(-5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: **-5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The nested loop for applying gravitational forces is inefficient, especially since it recalculates forces for all pairs of particles every iteration. The reference script uses a more efficient approach with combinations. **(-5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: **-5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for edge cases, such as division by zero in gravitational force calculations. The reference script handles these aspects better. **(-5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: **-5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup in the provided code is basic and lacks the enhancements seen in the reference script, such as adding a logo, skybox, and typical lights. **(-3 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: **-3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: **-45 points**
- Correctness: **-25 points**
- Code Quality: **-5 points**
- Efficiency: **-5 points**
- Error Handling and Robustness: **-5 points**
- Use of Visualization Tools: **-3 points**

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: **-88 points**
- Final Score: **100 - 88 = 12 points**

### Final Score

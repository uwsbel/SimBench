### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. However, there are some minor omissions:
     - The second pendulum's initial position is set to `(1.5, 0, 1)` instead of `(3, 0, 1)` as in the reference script. This is a significant deviation as it affects the simulation's behavior.
     - The comments for the revolute joints in the reference script provide clarity on their function, which is missing in the provided code.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - 10 points for incorrect initial position of the second pendulum.
     - 5 points for lack of comments on joint functionality.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code uses the PyChrono API correctly in most instances. However, there are some issues:
     - The time step in the simulation loop is set to `1e-3`, while the reference script uses `1e-2`. This could lead to a significant difference in simulation behavior.
     - The initialization of the second revolute joint does not match the reference script's parameters, which could affect the pendulum's motion.
   - **Deductions**:
     - 15 points for incorrect time step.
     - 10 points for incorrect initialization of the second revolute joint.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable. However, it lacks some comments that explain the purpose of certain sections, particularly around the joint initialization and the simulation loop.
   - **Deductions**:
     - 5 points for insufficient comments.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit any unnecessary calculations or redundant code. However, the time step used in the simulation loop could be optimized for better performance.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - 3 points for not using the optimized time step as in the reference script.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms. The reference script does not explicitly include error handling either, but it is generally a good practice to include checks for system states or potential errors.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - 5 points for lack of error handling.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the window title in the provided code is "Double Pendulum demo" instead of "Double Pendulum Simulation" as in the reference script. This is a minor issue but still a deviation.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - 2 points for minor visualization issue (window title).
   - **Total Deductions**: 2 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 15 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from 100 points, the total deductions are 55 points.

Final Score: **100 - 55 = 45**

### Final Score Output
[[45]]

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. However, there are minor deviations:
     - The `SetArea`, `SetIyy`, and `SetIzz` methods in the `minertia` and `melasticity` sections lack semicolons at the end of the lines in the reference script, which is a minor formatting issue. 
     - The `SetMotorFunction` uses a different implementation of the custom function compared to the reference script, which is a significant deviation.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for minor formatting issues and 10 points for the different motor function implementation.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The custom motor function in the provided code is significantly different from the reference script, which could lead to different simulation behavior. This is a major issue.
   - The rest of the code appears to be logically correct, with proper initialization of bodies and joints.
   - **Deductions**: 15 points for incorrect use of the motor function.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable. However, there are some areas where comments could be more descriptive, especially regarding the purpose of certain parameters in the custom motor function.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not show any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, the custom motor function could potentially be optimized for clarity and performance.
   - **Deductions**: 3 points for missing optimization opportunities.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any explicit error handling mechanisms. The reference script does not show any either, but it is generally good practice to include checks.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of error handling.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor differences in the implementation of visual elements compared to the reference script.
   - **Deductions**: 3 points for minor visualization issues.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 15 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 46 points
- Final Score: 100 - 46 = 54

### Final Score Output

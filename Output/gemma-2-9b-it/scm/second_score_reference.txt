### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components (15 points each)**: The provided code lacks the structured parameter initialization for the terrain, which is present in the reference script. The reference script uses a dedicated class (`SCMParameters`) to encapsulate soil parameters and their initialization, while the provided code directly initializes terrain parameters without such a structure. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Minor Omissions (5 points)**: The provided code does not include a comment section explaining the purpose of the `SCMTerrainParams` class, which is present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Completeness: 20 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API (15 points)**: The provided code initializes the terrain parameters directly in the `SCMTerrainParams` class, which could lead to inconsistencies in parameter management. The reference script uses a dedicated method to set parameters, which is more robust and clear. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors (10 points)**: There are no significant logical errors in the provided code, as it follows the general structure of the reference script. However, the lack of a structured approach to parameter management could lead to potential issues in more complex scenarios. No deduction here.
   - **Minor Inaccuracies (5 points)**: The provided code uses `terrain_params` directly without a clear initialization method, which could lead to confusion. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Correctness: 20 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 points)**: The provided code is relatively readable but lacks the structured approach seen in the reference script. The use of a dedicated class for terrain parameters in the reference script enhances clarity and maintainability. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Comments and Documentation (5 points)**: The provided code has fewer comments explaining the purpose of certain sections compared to the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Code Quality: 10 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations (5 points)**: The provided code does not exhibit any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, the direct initialization of parameters could lead to redundancy in larger simulations. No deduction here.
   - **Missing Optimization Opportunities (3 points)**: The provided code could benefit from a more structured approach to parameter management, as seen in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Efficiency: 3 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling (5 points)**: The provided code does not include any error handling for invalid soil types in the `SCMTerrainParams` class, which is present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Incorrect or Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 points)**: The provided code sets up visualization tools correctly, but it lacks some of the additional visual elements (like skybox and directional light) that enhance the visual experience in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Minor Visualization Issues (2 points)**: There are no significant minor visualization issues. No deduction here.

   **Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 20 points
- Correctness: 20 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 20 + 20 + 10 + 3 + 5 + 3 = 61 points
- Final Score: 100 - 61 = 39

### Final Score Output

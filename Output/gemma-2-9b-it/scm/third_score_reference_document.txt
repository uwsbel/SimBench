### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code does not include the creation of additional bodies (like the boxes in the reference code) that could enhance the simulation environment. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Minor Omissions**: The sensor manager is created, but the reference code includes more detailed sensor setups (e.g., multiple point lights and a camera sensor with filters). This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 + 5 = **20 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The provided code uses `chrono.ChPointLight()` without proper initialization or context, which could lead to issues in rendering. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: The provided code does not handle the camera sensor properly compared to the reference code, which initializes the camera with specific parameters. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 + 10 = **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured, but it lacks some comments that could clarify the purpose of certain sections, especially around sensor management. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The code includes a random light generation loop that could be optimized or structured better. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are present in the reference code. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The provided code lacks the detailed setup of visualization elements (like multiple point lights and camera filters) that enhance the visual experience. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 20 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 20 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = **65 points**
- Final Score: 100 - 65 = **35 points**

### Final Score Output

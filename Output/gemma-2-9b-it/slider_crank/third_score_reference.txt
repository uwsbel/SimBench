### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. However, there are some minor deviations:
     - The joint types used in the provided code differ from the reference (e.g., `ChLinkBallSocket` vs. `ChLinkLockSpherical` and `ChLinkPlane` vs. `ChLinkLockPlanar`). This is a significant difference in terms of functionality and could affect the simulation behavior.
     - The comments in the provided code are less detailed compared to the reference.
   - **Deductions**: 15 points for incorrect joint types (missing essential details).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code uses the PyChrono API correctly in most instances. However, the use of `ChLinkBallSocket` instead of `ChLinkLockSpherical` and `ChLinkPlane` instead of `ChLinkLockPlanar` could lead to significant changes in simulation behavior.
   - **Deductions**: 15 points for incorrect joint initialization.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally readable and structured well, but it lacks the level of documentation present in the reference script. The comments are less descriptive, which could hinder understanding for someone unfamiliar with the code.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, there are minor opportunities for optimization that are not utilized.
   - **Deductions**: 3 points for missing obvious optimization opportunities.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks explicit error handling mechanisms. The reference script appears to be more robust in this regard.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of basic error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup in the provided code is mostly adequate but lacks some of the detailed setup present in the reference script. The lighting and camera setup could be improved.
   - **Deductions**: 3 points for inadequate visualization setup.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 15 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 46 points
- Final Score: 100 - 46 = 54

### Final Score Output

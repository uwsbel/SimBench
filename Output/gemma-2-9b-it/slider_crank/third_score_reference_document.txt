### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code is mostly complete but uses `ChLinkBallSocket()` instead of `ChLinkLockSpherical()` for the joints, which is a significant deviation from the reference. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Incorrect Configuration**: The `ChLinkPlane()` joint is also incorrectly used instead of `ChLinkLockPlanar()`, leading to another **15 points** deduction.
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: The use of `ChLinkBallSocket()` instead of `ChLinkLockSpherical()` is a significant error, leading to a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: The `ChLinkPlane()` joint is also a logical error, leading to another **15 points** deduction.
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks some comments that explain the purpose of certain sections. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The code does not exhibit any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference. However, the use of `sys.DoStepDynamics(1e-3)` could be optimized by using a variable for the time step, but this is a minor point. Thus, no deductions are made here.
   - **Total Deductions**: 0 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The code does not implement any error handling or checks for potential issues that could arise during simulation. This leads to a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor issues with the lighting and camera setup compared to the reference. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 30 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 30 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 3 = 73 points
- Final Score: 100 - 73 = 27

### Final Score Output

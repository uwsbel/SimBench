### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The provided code does not include the creation of a solver, which is present in the reference script. This is essential for the simulation to run effectively. **(-15 points)**
     - The reference script uses a specific beam section and applies forces and torques to nodes, which are not present in the provided code. This significantly impacts the simulation's functionality. **(-15 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: 
     - The provided code uses `chrono.ChBeamSectionAdvanced()` instead of `fea.ChBeamSectionEulerAdvanced()`, which could lead to differences in the simulation behavior. **(-15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The provided code does not apply any forces or torques to the nodes, which is a critical part of the simulation in the reference script. **(-10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The provided code is relatively well-structured, but it lacks comments explaining the purpose of various sections, which are present in the reference script. **(-5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The provided code does not exhibit significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script, but it could benefit from a more structured approach to node and beam creation. However, no specific deductions are warranted here. **(-0 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 0 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms or checks, which are important for robustness. The reference script handles constraints and connections more explicitly. **(-5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code lacks detailed visualization of the beam elements and nodes, which are included in the reference script. This impacts the clarity of the simulation output. **(-5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: **-30 points**
- Correctness: **-25 points**
- Code Quality: **-5 points**
- Efficiency: **-0 points**
- Error Handling and Robustness: **-5 points**
- Use of Visualization Tools: **-5 points**

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a full score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 25 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 5 = 70 points
- Final Score: 100 - 70 = 30 points

### Final Score

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script, such as system initialization, mesh creation, beam section definition, node and element addition, force application, constraints, visualization setup, and the simulation loop.
   - **Deductions**: None.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly uses the PyChrono API for the most part. However, there is a logical error in the way the second beam is created. The reference script uses the last node created from the previous beam as the starting point for the next beam, while the provided code uses a hardcoded point. This could lead to incorrect connections between elements.
   - **Deductions**: 10 points for the logical error in beam creation.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, with appropriate comments explaining the purpose of various sections. However, some comments could be more descriptive, especially regarding the constraints and force applications.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code is efficient and does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows the reference script closely in terms of efficiency.
   - **Deductions**: None.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any explicit error handling or checks for potential issues (e.g., ensuring nodes are correctly initialized before use). The reference script does not explicitly handle errors either, but it is generally a good practice to include basic checks.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup in the provided code is consistent with the reference script, including the addition of visual shapes and the initialization of the Irrlicht visualization system.
   - **Deductions**: None.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points deducted
- Correctness: 10 points deducted (logical error in beam creation)
- Code Quality: 5 points deducted (insufficient comments)
- Efficiency: 0 points deducted
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points deducted (lack of error handling)
- Use of Visualization Tools: 0 points deducted

### Final Score Calculation
Starting score: 100 points  
Deductions: 10 (Correctness) + 5 (Code Quality) + 5 (Error Handling) = 20 points  
Final Score: 100 - 20 = 80

**Final Score: [[80]]**

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks the initialization of gravitational acceleration and collision system type, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
     - The reference script includes a rover with a driver, which is not present in the provided code. This results in an additional deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of PyChrono API**: 
     - The provided code uses `SetFixed(True)` for all bodies, which is incorrect for the box, cylinder, cone, and sphere if they are intended to be dynamic. This could lead to significant changes in simulation behavior. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The force generator is set to zero and does not apply any force, which may not be the intended behavior. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The code is relatively well-structured, but it lacks comments explaining the purpose of various sections, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The code creates multiple bodies with the same properties (mass, inertia, position), which is redundant. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the success of operations, which the reference script implicitly handles. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code does not set up shadows or optimize the camera settings as effectively as the reference script. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 73 points
- Final Score: 100 - 73 = 27

### Final Score Output
[[27]]

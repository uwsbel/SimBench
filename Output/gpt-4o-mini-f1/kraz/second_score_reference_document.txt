### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script, such as system initialization, vehicle creation, and visualization setup. Therefore, no points are deducted in this category.
   - **Score: 40/40**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The steering values in the provided code differ from the reference script during the double lane change maneuver. The reference uses `0.3` and `-0.3`, while the provided code uses `0.5` and `-0.5`. This is a significant deviation that could lead to different vehicle behavior.
   - **Deduction: 15 points for incorrect steering values.**
   - **Score: 15/30**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names and consistent formatting. However, there are minor comments that could be improved for clarity.
   - **Deduction: 5 points for insufficient comments.**
   - **Score: 5/10**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not appear to have unnecessary calculations or redundant code compared to the reference script. It follows the same structure and logic.
   - **Score: 10/10**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not implement any specific error handling or robustness checks, which are not explicitly present in the reference script either. However, it could benefit from additional checks for robustness.
   - **Deduction: 3 points for inadequate handling of edge cases.**
   - **Score: 2/5**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup in the provided code closely follows the reference script, with no significant issues noted. The camera, lighting, and other visual elements are adequately configured.
   - **Score: 5/5**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points deducted
- Correctness: 15 points deducted (incorrect steering values)
- Code Quality: 5 points deducted (insufficient comments)
- Efficiency: 0 points deducted
- Error Handling and Robustness: 3 points deducted (inadequate handling of edge cases)
- Use of Visualization Tools: 0 points deducted

### Final Score Calculation
- Total Score: 40 (Completeness) + 15 (Correctness) + 5 (Code Quality) + 10 (Efficiency) + 2 (Error Handling) + 5 (Visualization) = 77

**Final Score: [[77]]**

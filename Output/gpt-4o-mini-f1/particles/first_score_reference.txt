### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks several essential components present in the reference script:
     - The reference script uses a `ChParticleEmitter` class with specific configurations for particle emission, which is not fully replicated in the provided code. The provided code uses a custom `ParticleEmitter` class that does not match the functionality and configurability of the reference emitter. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - The reference script includes a callback mechanism for adding bodies to the emitter, which is absent in the provided code. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: The provided code uses a custom gravitational force calculation that does not match the reference script's approach, which uses a modified gravitational constant and a more structured force accumulation method. This could lead to significant differences in simulation behavior. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors**: The provided code does not reset the accumulators for each body before applying forces, which is a logical error compared to the reference script. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code is relatively readable, but it lacks meaningful comments and documentation compared to the reference script. The variable names are somewhat generic, and the structure could be improved. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The provided code calculates gravitational forces in a less efficient manner by iterating through all body pairs, which is less efficient than the combination approach used in the reference script. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for edge cases, such as ensuring that the distance between bodies is not zero before calculating forces. The reference script handles these cases more robustly. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The provided code sets up visualization but lacks the detailed configuration and callbacks present in the reference script. The reference script uses a more comprehensive approach to bind visual items and set textures. **(Deduct 3 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a total of 100 points:
- Deductions: 30 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 73 points
- Final Score: 100 - 73 = 27 points

### Final Score Output

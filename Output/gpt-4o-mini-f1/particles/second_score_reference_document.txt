### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script, such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. Therefore, no points are deducted in this category.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The use of the PyChrono API is generally correct, but there is a significant issue with the gravitational constant being modified (`G_constant = 6.674e-3`). This could lead to incorrect simulation behavior, as it deviates from standard gravitational calculations without justification. 
   - Additionally, the potential energy calculation does not handle the case where `r_attract` could be zero, which would lead to a division by zero error.
   - **Score: 15 points deducted for incorrect use of the gravitational constant and potential energy calculation.**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. However, there are some areas where comments could be improved to enhance understanding, particularly around the energy calculations and the purpose of certain variables.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted for insufficient comments.**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code has some redundancy, particularly in the way forces are accumulated in the loop. The calculation of forces between all pairs of bodies could be optimized by avoiding repeated calculations of the same distances.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted for unnecessary calculations.**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The code lacks basic error handling, particularly in the potential energy calculation where it does not check for division by zero. This could lead to runtime errors in certain scenarios.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted for lack of error handling.**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is consistent with the reference script, and all necessary elements are included. No deductions are warranted in this category.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points deducted
- Correctness: 15 points deducted
- Code Quality: 5 points deducted
- Efficiency: 5 points deducted
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points deducted
- Use of Visualization Tools: 0 points deducted

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- 0 (Completeness) 
- 15 (Correctness) 
- 5 (Code Quality) 
- 5 (Efficiency) 
- 5 (Error Handling and Robustness) 
- 0 (Use of Visualization Tools)

Total deductions: 30 points

Final Score: **100 - 30 = 70**

**Final Score: [[70]]**

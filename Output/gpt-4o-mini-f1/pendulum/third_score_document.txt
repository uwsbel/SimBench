### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

#### Completeness (40 points total)
- **System Initialization**: The system is correctly initialized with `chrono.ChSystemNSC()`. (0 points deducted)
- **Body Creation**: Both pendulum bodies and the ground body are created and added to the system. (0 points deducted)
- **Visualization Setup**: The visualization system is created and configured properly. (0 points deducted)
- **Essential Components**: All essential components are present, including bodies, joints, and visualization. (0 points deducted)
- **Minor Omissions**: The script could benefit from defining contact materials for the pendulums and ground, which is a common practice in simulations. (5 points deducted)

**Total Deductions for Completeness: 5 points**

#### Correctness (30 points total)
- **API Usage**: The API is used correctly for body creation, joint initialization, and visualization. (0 points deducted)
- **Logical Errors**: The revolute joint initialization for both pendulums appears correct. However, the position of the revolute joint for `rev_1` and `rev_2` may not align with the physical setup, as the joint frames should be at the pivot points of the pendulums. This could lead to incorrect behavior in the simulation. (10 points deducted)
- **Minor Inaccuracies**: No significant inaccuracies noted. (0 points deducted)

**Total Deductions for Correctness: 10 points**

#### Code Quality (10 points total)
- **Readability and Structure**: The code is well-structured and readable, with consistent formatting. (0 points deducted)
- **Comments**: While there are some comments, they could be more detailed, especially regarding the purpose of each section and the parameters used in the joint initialization. (5 points deducted)

**Total Deductions for Code Quality: 5 points**

#### Efficiency (10 points total)
- **Unnecessary Calculations**: The code does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. (0 points deducted)
- **Optimization Opportunities**: There are no obvious optimization opportunities that are missed. (0 points deducted)

**Total Deductions for Efficiency: 0 points**

#### Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)
- **Basic Error Handling**: The script lacks error handling for potential issues, such as checking if bodies are added successfully or if the visualization system initializes correctly. (5 points deducted)

**Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points**

#### Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)
- **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the addition of a skybox and typical lights could be considered standard practice for better visual quality. (2 points deducted)
- **Minor Visualization Issues**: No significant issues noted. (0 points deducted)

**Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points**

### Final Score Calculation
- **Total Points Deducted**: 5 (Completeness) + 10 (Correctness) + 5 (Code Quality) + 0 (Efficiency) + 5 (Error Handling) + 2 (Visualization) = 27 points
- **Final Score**: 100 - 27 = 73

### Final Score Output
[[73]]

### Summary of Deductions
- **Completeness**: Minor omission of contact materials (5 points).
- **Correctness**: Logical error in joint initialization (10 points).
- **Code Quality**: Insufficient comments (5 points).
- **Error Handling**: Lack of basic error handling (5 points).
- **Use of Visualization Tools**: Minor issues with visualization setup (2 points).

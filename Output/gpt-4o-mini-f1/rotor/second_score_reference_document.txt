### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script, such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. Therefore, no points are deducted here.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code uses `CH_PI = 3.1456`, which is an inaccurate approximation of π. The correct value should be `CH_PI = chrono.CH_C_PI`. This is a significant error as it affects calculations involving geometry and physics.
     - **Deduction: 15 points**
   - The rest of the code appears to correctly implement the PyChrono API as per the reference script, with no logical errors or incorrect configurations noted.
   - **Score: 15 points deducted**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names and appropriate comments. However, the comment for the gravity setting could be more descriptive regarding the context of the change.
   - **Deduction: 5 points for minor comment improvement**
   - **Score: 5 points deducted**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit any unnecessary calculations or redundant code compared to the reference script. It efficiently uses the PyChrono API without any apparent optimization issues.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The code lacks explicit error handling mechanisms, such as checks for successful initialization of bodies or the visualization system. The reference script does not explicitly handle errors either, but it is generally good practice to include basic error handling.
   - **Deduction: 5 points**
   - **Score: 5 points deducted**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is consistent with the reference script, including the addition of the logo, skybox, and camera settings. There are no significant issues noted in this area.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points deducted
- Correctness: 15 points deducted (incorrect π value)
- Code Quality: 5 points deducted (minor comment improvement)
- Efficiency: 0 points deducted
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points deducted (lack of error handling)
- Use of Visualization Tools: 0 points deducted

### Final Score Calculation
- Total deductions: 15 + 5 + 5 = 25 points
- Maximum score: 100 points
- Final score: 100 - 25 = 75

### Final Score Output
[[75]]

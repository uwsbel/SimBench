### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code is mostly complete, but there are some minor deviations from the reference script. 
   - **Deductions:**
     - **5 points** for the use of a slightly different motor function (the reference uses different parameters for the motor function).
     - **5 points** for the absence of comments explaining the purpose of the motor function and other key components.
   - **Total Deductions: 10 points.**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code has some inaccuracies in the motor function parameters and the initial values for the motor speed.
   - **Deductions:**
     - **10 points** for the incorrect parameters in the `ChFunctionMyFun` class compared to the reference (A1, A2, T1, T2, T3, and w are different).
     - **5 points** for minor inaccuracies in the initialization of the flywheel and its position.
   - **Total Deductions: 15 points.**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured, but it lacks sufficient comments and documentation.
   - **Deductions:**
     - **5 points** for insufficient comments explaining the purpose of various sections of the code.
     - **5 points** for minor readability issues, such as inconsistent spacing and formatting.
   - **Total Deductions: 10 points.**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script.
   - **Deductions:**
     - **0 points** as the code is efficient and follows the reference script closely in terms of API usage.
   - **Total Deductions: 0 points.**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms.
   - **Deductions:**
     - **5 points** for the lack of basic error handling or checks that could improve robustness.
   - **Total Deductions: 5 points.**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor differences in the lighting and camera setup.
   - **Deductions:**
     - **3 points** for minor differences in the visualization setup compared to the reference script.
   - **Total Deductions: 3 points.**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 10 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
- Starting from 100 points:
  - Total Deductions: 10 + 15 + 10 + 0 + 5 + 3 = 43 points
- Final Score: 100 - 43 = 57 points

### Final Score Output
[[57]]

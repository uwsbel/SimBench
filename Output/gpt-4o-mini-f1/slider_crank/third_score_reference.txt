### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. However, there are minor deviations:
     - The comment for the piston joint initialization is missing, which is present in the reference script. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - Total deductions: **5 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code uses the PyChrono API correctly in most instances. However, there is a logical error in the initialization of the planar joint:
     - The reference script uses `plane_plane` for the planar joint, while the provided code uses `mjointC`, which could lead to confusion. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - Total deductions: **10 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The provided code is relatively readable and well-structured. However, it lacks some comments that would enhance understanding, particularly in the initialization sections. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - Total deductions: **5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code is efficient and does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. There are no significant optimization opportunities missed compared to the reference script. **(No deductions)**
   - Total deductions: **0 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms. The reference script does not explicitly handle errors either, but it is generally good practice to include basic error handling. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - Total deductions: **5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there is a minor issue with the lighting setup compared to the reference script. **(Deduct 2 points)**
   - Total deductions: **2 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 10 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total deductions: 5 + 10 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 2 = 27 points
- Final score: 100 - 27 = 73

### Final Score Output
[[73]]

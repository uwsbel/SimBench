### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes the essential components such as system initialization, mesh creation, and visualization setup. However, it lacks the explicit disabling of gravity, which is mentioned in the reference script. This omission leads to a deduction of **5 points**.
   - The code also does not include the creation of interpolation functions for reference tracking or monitoring nodes and elements, which are present in the reference. This results in a deduction of **15 points** for missing essential components.
   - Total deductions: **20 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code uses the PyChrono API correctly in most parts. However, there is a potential issue with the way the boundary nodes are set for the elements, which could lead to incorrect mesh connectivity. This warrants a deduction of **10 points** for logical errors.
   - Total deductions: **10 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally readable and well-structured, but it lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of certain blocks, especially around the mesh creation and element setup. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - Total deductions: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, there are minor areas where the code could be optimized, such as the way boundary nodes are handled. This leads to a deduction of **3 points** for missing optimization opportunities.
   - Total deductions: **3 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The error handling for the output directory creation is present and correctly implemented. However, there is no handling for potential issues that could arise during the mesh creation or element setup. This results in a deduction of **3 points** for inadequate handling of edge cases.
   - Total deductions: **3 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but it lacks the explicit setting of gravity options and the interpolation functions for monitoring, which are present in the reference. This leads to a deduction of **3 points**.
   - Total deductions: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: **20 points**
- Correctness: **10 points**
- Code Quality: **5 points**
- Efficiency: **3 points**
- Error Handling and Robustness: **3 points**
- Use of Visualization Tools: **3 points**

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a total of 100 points:
- Total deductions: 20 + 10 + 5 + 3 + 3 + 3 = **44 points**
- Final score: 100 - 44 = **56 points**

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script, such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. Therefore, no points are deducted in this category.
   - **Score: 40/40**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly uses the PyChrono API for the most part. However, there are some minor inaccuracies:
     - The `sys.DoStepDynamics(0.001)` is called with a fixed timestep, which may not be optimal for all simulations. While this is not a significant error, it could lead to issues in more complex simulations.
     - The `SetAutomaticGravity(False)` is used, which is appropriate, but the reference script does not explicitly mention this setting. It may be better to leave gravity enabled unless there is a specific reason to disable it.
   - **Deductions: 5 points for minor inaccuracies.**
   - **Score: 25/30**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable. Variable names are meaningful, and the comments are adequate. However, there are some areas where comments could be more detailed to enhance understanding.
   - **Deductions: 5 points for insufficient comments in some sections.**
   - **Score: 5/10**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, there are a few instances where the code could be optimized, such as avoiding redundant calculations or unnecessary object creations.
   - **Deductions: 3 points for missing obvious optimization opportunities.**
   - **Score: 7/10**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The code lacks explicit error handling mechanisms. For example, there are no checks for the successful initialization of bodies or constraints, which could lead to issues if any part of the setup fails.
   - **Deductions: 5 points for lack of basic error handling.**
   - **Score: 0/5**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct and follows the reference script closely. However, there are minor issues with lighting and camera positioning that could be improved for better visualization.
   - **Deductions: 3 points for minor visualization issues.**
   - **Score: 2/5**

### Final Score Calculation
- Completeness: 40/40
- Correctness: 25/30
- Code Quality: 5/10
- Efficiency: 7/10
- Error Handling and Robustness: 0/5
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2/5

**Total Score: 40 + 25 + 5 + 7 + 0 + 2 = 79/100**

### Final Score Output

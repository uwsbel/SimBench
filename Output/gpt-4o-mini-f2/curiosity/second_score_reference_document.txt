### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script. There are no missing components, so no points are deducted here.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly uses the PyChrono API for the most part. However, there is a minor logical error in the way the rover's dynamics are updated. The `rover.Update()` method is called, which is not necessary as the dynamics are already advanced by `system.DoStepDynamics(time_step)`. This could lead to confusion about the simulation's state.
   - **Score: 10 points deducted**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable. However, there are some comments that could be more descriptive, particularly around the initialization of the rover and the visualization setup. The comments do not fully explain the purpose of certain configurations.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code is efficient, but the unnecessary call to `rover.Update()` adds redundancy. This could be optimized by removing that line, as it does not contribute to the simulation's performance.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The script lacks any form of error handling or checks for potential issues, such as verifying if the visualization system initializes correctly or if the rover is properly set up. This could lead to runtime errors that are not handled.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is adequate and closely follows the reference script. However, the commented-out line for enabling shadows could be considered a minor issue, as it may affect the visual quality of the simulation. 
   - **Score: 3 points deducted**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points deducted
- Correctness: 10 points deducted
- Code Quality: 5 points deducted
- Efficiency: 5 points deducted
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points deducted
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points deducted

### Final Score Calculation
Total deductions: 0 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 28 points deducted from a total of 100 points.

Final Score: 100 - 28 = 72

### Final Score Output

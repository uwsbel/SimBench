### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code is mostly complete, but there are some minor omissions and deviations from the reference script.
   - **Deductions:**
     - **5 points** for minor omissions in comments and explanations that could enhance understanding.
     - **5 points** for slight deviations in the setup of the pulley and belt constraints compared to the reference.
   - **Total Deductions: 10 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code generally uses the PyChrono API correctly, but there are some logical errors and incorrect configurations.
   - **Deductions:**
     - **10 points** for incorrect initialization of the belt link (should be `ChLinkLockPulley` instead of `ChLinkBeltPulley`).
     - **5 points** for the incorrect setting of the rotation for the bevel gear joint (should be around Y-axis instead of X-axis).
   - **Total Deductions: 15 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is structured reasonably well, but there are areas where readability could be improved.
   - **Deductions:**
     - **5 points** for insufficient comments explaining the purpose of certain sections or variables.
     - **5 points** for minor readability issues, such as inconsistent spacing and formatting.
   - **Total Deductions: 10 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code is efficient overall, but there are some unnecessary calculations or redundant code.
   - **Deductions:**
     - **5 points** for redundant calls to set the same properties multiple times (e.g., setting the same rotation for different gears).
   - **Total Deductions: 5 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The code lacks basic error handling and does not account for potential issues that could arise during simulation.
   - **Deductions:**
     - **5 points** for the absence of error handling mechanisms or checks for successful initialization of components.
   - **Total Deductions: 5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor issues.
   - **Deductions:**
     - **3 points** for not including the drawing of segments for the belt, which is present in the reference.
   - **Total Deductions: 3 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 10 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 48 points
- Final Score: 100 - 48 = 52

### Final Score Output

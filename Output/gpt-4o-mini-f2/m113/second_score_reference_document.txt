### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script, such as vehicle initialization, terrain setup, visualization, and driver system. Therefore, no points are deducted here.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - There are discrepancies in the soil parameters for the SCM terrain. The reference script uses `2e6` for `Kphi`, while the provided script uses `2e5`, which is a significant change in simulation behavior. Similarly, the elastic stiffness is set to `2e8` in the reference, while the provided script uses `2e7`. These are critical parameters that affect the simulation's accuracy.
   - **Score: 30 points deducted (15 points for each incorrect parameter).**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable. However, it lacks comments explaining the purpose of certain sections, especially around the initialization of the vehicle and terrain. The reference script provides better documentation in this regard.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted for insufficient comments.**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not exhibit any unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows the structure of the reference script closely, and there are no apparent optimization opportunities missed.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, such as checking if the visualization system or vehicle initializes correctly. The reference script does not explicitly handle errors either, but it is generally good practice to include such checks.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted for lack of error handling.**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is consistent with the reference script, including the addition of lights, skybox, and logo. There are no significant issues in this area.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points
- Correctness: 30 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization: 0 points

### Final Score Calculation
- Total Points Deducted: 30 + 5 + 5 = 40 points
- Starting Score: 100 points
- Final Score: 100 - 40 = 60 points

### Final Score

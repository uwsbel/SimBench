### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script, such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. Therefore, no points are deducted in this category.
   - **Score: 40/40**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The use of the PyChrono API is correct, and there are no significant changes in simulation behavior compared to the reference script. The initialization of the springs and bodies is consistent with the reference.
   - There are no logical errors or incorrect settings of body properties.
   - **Score: 30/30**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. However, the comments are slightly less descriptive than those in the reference script, which could enhance understanding.
   - Deducting 5 points for insufficient comments.
   - **Score: 5/10**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It efficiently uses the PyChrono API similar to the reference script.
   - No deductions are necessary in this category.
   - **Score: 10/10**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any explicit error handling or robustness checks, which are not present in the reference script either. However, this could be improved.
   - Deducting 5 points for lack of basic error handling.
   - **Score: 0/5**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is adequate and mirrors the reference script closely. There are no significant issues with the visualization tools used.
   - No deductions are necessary in this category.
   - **Score: 5/5**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points deducted
- Correctness: 0 points deducted
- Code Quality: 5 points deducted for insufficient comments
- Efficiency: 0 points deducted
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points deducted for lack of error handling
- Use of Visualization Tools: 0 points deducted

### Final Score Calculation
Total Score = 40 + 30 + 5 + 10 + 0 + 5 = 90

Final Score: [[90]]

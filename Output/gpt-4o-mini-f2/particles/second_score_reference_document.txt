### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, visualization, and simulation loop. Therefore, no points are deducted in this category.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly uses the PyChrono API for the most part. However, there is a potential issue with the calculation of gravitational potential energy. The code does not handle the case where the distance `r_attract` could be zero, which would lead to a division by zero error. This is a significant logical error.
   - **Score: 15 points deducted**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable. However, there are some areas where comments could be improved to enhance understanding, especially in complex sections like energy calculations. The variable names are meaningful, but additional comments would help clarify the purpose of certain calculations.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code contains some redundant calculations, particularly in the energy calculations where forces are accumulated for every pair of bodies. This could be optimized by storing results or using more efficient data structures. However, the overall structure is efficient enough for the simulation's purpose.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The code lacks error handling for potential issues such as division by zero in the potential energy calculation. It also does not account for edge cases where there might be no bodies in the system. This could lead to runtime errors.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is adequate and mirrors the reference script closely. However, there could be minor improvements in lighting or camera angles to enhance the visual experience. Still, these are not significant enough to warrant a major deduction.
   - **Score: 2 points deducted**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- 100 - (0 + 15 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 2) = 100 - 32 = 68

### Final Score
[[68]]

### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

#### Completeness (40 points total)
- **System Initialization**: The script correctly initializes the `ChSystemNSC` and sets the collision system type. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Body Creation**: Three spheres are created with appropriate properties and added to the system. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Visualization Setup**: The visualization system is set up correctly with a window size, title, and camera. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Missing Components**: The script lacks a call to `chrono.SetChronoDataPath()` to set the data path for textures, which is essential for loading resources. **(15 points deducted)**
- **Total Deductions**: 15 points

#### Correctness (30 points total)
- **API Usage**: The API is used correctly for most parts, including body creation and force accumulation. However, the gravitational constant is modified without justification, which could lead to unexpected results. **(15 points deducted)**
- **Logical Errors**: The potential energy calculation does not handle the case where the distance `r_attract` could be zero, which would lead to division by zero errors. **(10 points deducted)**
- **Total Deductions**: 25 points

#### Code Quality (10 points total)
- **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Comments**: There are insufficient comments explaining the purpose of various sections of the code, which would help in understanding the flow and logic. **(5 points deducted)**
- **Total Deductions**: 5 points

#### Efficiency (10 points total)
- **Unnecessary Calculations**: The calculation of total energy and forces is done in a loop over all bodies, which is efficient but could be optimized further by caching results or avoiding repeated calculations. **(5 points deducted)**
- **Total Deductions**: 5 points

#### Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)
- **Error Handling**: There is no error handling for potential issues such as missing textures or invalid body configurations. **(5 points deducted)**
- **Total Deductions**: 5 points

#### Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)
- **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the lighting and camera angles could be improved for better visibility. **(3 points deducted)**
- **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
- **Total Points Deducted**: 15 (Completeness) + 25 (Correctness) + 5 (Code Quality) + 5 (Efficiency) + 5 (Error Handling) + 3 (Visualization) = 58 points deducted
- **Final Score**: 100 - 58 = 42

### Final Score Output
[[42]] 

### Explanation of Deductions
1. **Completeness**: Missing essential call to set the data path for textures.
2. **Correctness**: Potential division by zero in energy calculations and an arbitrary modification of the gravitational constant.
3. **Code Quality**: Lack of comments explaining the code.
4. **Efficiency**: Some calculations could be optimized.
5. **Error Handling**: No error handling for potential issues.
6. **Use of Visualization Tools**: Minor issues with lighting and camera setup.

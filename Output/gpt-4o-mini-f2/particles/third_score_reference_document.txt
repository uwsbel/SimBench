### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components: system initialization, body creation, visualization, and particle emission. Therefore, no points are deducted in this category.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly uses the PyChrono API for creating bodies, setting properties, and running the simulation. However, the gravitational constant `G_constant` is modified to `6.674e-3`, which is not standard for gravitational simulations (the typical value is `6.674e-11` m³/kg/s²). This could lead to significant changes in simulation behavior.
   - **Score: 15 points deducted for incorrect use of the gravitational constant.**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. However, there are minimal comments explaining the purpose of certain blocks of code, which could enhance understanding for someone unfamiliar with the script.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted for insufficient comments.**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code performs necessary calculations for kinetic and potential energy, but the repeated calculation of distances and forces in the energy calculation loop could be optimized. The reference script does not show any unnecessary calculations, while the provided script calculates forces multiple times.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted for unnecessary calculations.**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks error handling mechanisms, such as checking for division by zero when calculating potential energy. The reference script does not explicitly handle these cases either, but it is a common best practice to include such checks.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted for lack of basic error handling.**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is correctly implemented, matching the reference script. There are no significant issues with the visualization tools used.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 0 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a total of 100 points:
- Total deductions: 15 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 30 points
- Final score: 100 - 30 = 70

### Final Score

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components found in the reference script, such as system initialization, body creation, visualization setup, and the simulation loop. Therefore, there are no deductions in this category.
   - **Score: 40/40**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly initializes the pendulum and ground bodies, sets their properties, and creates a spherical joint. However, there is a minor issue with the use of `pend_1.SetPosDt(chrono.ChVector3d(0, 0, 1))`, which sets the linear velocity instead of the angular velocity. This could lead to unexpected simulation behavior.
   - **Deductions: 10 points for logical error in setting body properties.**
   - **Score: 20/30**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable. Variable names are meaningful, and there are sufficient comments explaining the purpose of various sections. However, the comments could be more detailed in some areas, particularly regarding the visualization setup.
   - **Deductions: 5 points for insufficient comments.**
   - **Score: 5/10**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code is efficient and follows best practices for simulation. There are no unnecessary calculations or redundant code present. The simulation loop is appropriately structured.
   - **Score: 10/10**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, such as checks for successful initialization of the visualization system or the bodies. This could lead to issues if the simulation fails to initialize correctly.
   - **Deductions: 5 points for lack of basic error handling.**
   - **Score: 0/5**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, with the addition of a logo, skybox, camera, and lights. However, there is no mention of setting up collision shapes for the visual elements, which is a minor oversight.
   - **Deductions: 2 points for minor visualization issues.**
   - **Score: 3/5**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points deducted
- Correctness: 10 points deducted
- Code Quality: 5 points deducted
- Efficiency: 0 points deducted
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points deducted
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points deducted

### Final Score Calculation
- Total Points: 40 + 20 + 5 + 10 + 0 + 3 = 78

### Final Score

### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The script includes essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. However, it lacks the definition of contact materials, which are crucial for realistic simulations involving collisions.
     - **Deduction**: 15 points for missing essential component (contact materials).
   - The script correctly initializes the simulation system and adds bodies and joints, but there are no comments or explanations for the purpose of each component.
     - **Deduction**: 5 points for minor omissions in comments/documentation.
   - **Total Deduction**: 20 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The use of `ChLinkLockRevolute` for joints is appropriate, but the initialization of the revolute joint for `pend_1` uses a position that may not align with the actual geometry of the pendulum. The frame for the revolute joint should ideally be at the pivot point of the pendulum.
     - **Deduction**: 10 points for logical errors in joint initialization.
   - The script does not set any contact material properties, which could lead to unrealistic simulation behavior.
     - **Deduction**: 15 points for incorrect use of the API that could significantly change simulation behavior.
   - **Total Deduction**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of each section and the significance of certain parameters.
     - **Deduction**: 5 points for insufficient comments.
   - **Total Deduction**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. However, the logging mechanism could be optimized by using a logging library instead of print statements for better performance and flexibility.
     - **Deduction**: 3 points for missing obvious optimization opportunities.
   - **Total Deduction**: 3 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The script lacks any form of error handling or checks for potential issues, such as ensuring that bodies are properly initialized before being added to the system.
     - **Deduction**: 5 points for lack of basic error handling.
   - **Total Deduction**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the lighting and camera positioning could be improved for better visibility of the simulation.
     - **Deduction**: 3 points for inadequate visualization setup.
   - **Total Deduction**: 3 points.

### Final Score Calculation
- **Total Points Deducted**: 20 (Completeness) + 25 (Correctness) + 5 (Code Quality) + 3 (Efficiency) + 5 (Error Handling) + 3 (Visualization) = 61 points deducted.
- **Final Score**: 100 - 61 = 39.

### Final Score Output
[[39]] 

### Explanation of Deductions
- Missing contact materials and insufficient comments led to significant deductions in completeness and correctness.
- Logical errors in joint initialization and lack of error handling further impacted the score.
- Minor deductions were made for visualization and efficiency improvements.

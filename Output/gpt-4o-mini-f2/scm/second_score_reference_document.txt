### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, vehicle creation, and visualization setup. However, the `SCMParameters` class in the provided code uses different method names (`GetSoftParameters`, `GetMidParameters`, `GetHardParameters`) compared to the reference script's `InitializeParametersAsSoft`, `InitializeParametersAsMid`, and `InitializeParametersAsHard`. This inconsistency could lead to confusion and potential errors in parameter initialization. **Deduction: 10 points.**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code correctly initializes the vehicle and terrain, but it uses different parameter values for `Bekker_Kphi` in the `GetHardParameters` method (5e6 in the provided code vs. 5301e3 in the reference). This could lead to significant differences in simulation behavior. **Deduction: 15 points.**
   - The terrain parameters are set correctly, but the method of setting them is different from the reference. The reference uses a direct initialization method, which is clearer and more consistent with the API. **Deduction: 5 points.**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of certain blocks, especially around parameter settings and the simulation loop. The reference script provides better documentation. **Deduction: 5 points.**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not exhibit any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference. However, there are minor opportunities for optimization in the way parameters are set and handled. **Deduction: 3 points.**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms or checks for the initialization of components, which could lead to runtime errors if any component fails to initialize correctly. The reference script does not explicitly handle errors either, but it is more robust in its structure. **Deduction: 5 points.**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup in the provided code is adequate, but it lacks some of the finer details present in the reference script, such as the addition of typical lights. **Deduction: 3 points.**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 10 points
- Correctness: 20 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 46 points
- Final Score: 100 - 46 = 54

### Final Score Output

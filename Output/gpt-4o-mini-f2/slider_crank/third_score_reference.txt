### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. However, it lacks detailed comments explaining each step, which are present in the reference script. 
   - **Deductions: 5 points** for minor omissions in documentation.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly initializes the system, creates bodies, and sets up joints. However, there is a minor issue with the initialization of the planar joint (`mjointC`). In the reference script, the joint is initialized with the correct parameters, while the provided code uses a different variable name (`mjointC` instead of `plane_plane`), which could lead to confusion.
   - **Deductions: 10 points** for logical errors in joint initialization.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks sufficient comments compared to the reference script. The variable names are meaningful, but the absence of detailed comments reduces clarity.
   - **Deductions: 5 points** for insufficient comments.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code is efficient and does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows the same structure as the reference script without any apparent inefficiencies.
   - **Deductions: 0 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling or robustness checks, which are not explicitly mentioned in the reference script but are generally good practice. This could lead to issues during execution if unexpected conditions arise.
   - **Deductions: 5 points** for lack of basic error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the provided code does not include the same level of detail in the comments regarding the visualization elements as the reference script. The setup is functional but could be improved.
   - **Deductions: 3 points** for inadequate visualization setup.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 10 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a full score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 5 + 10 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 3 = 28 points
- Final Score: 100 - 28 = 72

### Final Score Output
[[72]]

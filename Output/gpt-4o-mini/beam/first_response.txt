Certainly! Below is a Python script that demonstrates how to set up a PyChrono simulation using beam finite elements, including the initialization of the environment, creation of a physical system with a mesh of beams and nodes, and visualization using the Irrlicht engine.

```python
import pychrono.core as chrono
import pychrono.irrlicht as chronoirr

# Initialize the PyChrono environment
chrono.SetChronoDataPath('/path/to/chrono/data/')  # Set your Chrono data path
system = chrono.ChSystemNSC()

# Create a mesh of beams
beam_length = 1.0
beam_radius = 0.05
num_beams = 10

# Create a list to hold the beam nodes
nodes = []
beams = []

# Create nodes and beams
for i in range(num_beams):
    # Create a node at position (i * beam_length, 0, 0)
    node = chrono.ChNodeFEAxyz()
    node.SetPos(chrono.ChVectorD(i * beam_length, 0, 0))
    node.SetMass(1.0)  # Set mass of the node
    system.AddNode(node)
    nodes.append(node)

    # Create a beam element between the current node and the next one
    if i < num_beams - 1:
        beam = chrono.ChBeamSectionAdvanced()
        beam.SetDiameter(beam_radius)
        beam.SetYoungModulus(2.1e11)  # Young's modulus in Pascals
        beam.SetDensity(7800)  # Density in kg/m^3

        beam_element = chrono.ChBeamFEM(beam, nodes[i], nodes[i + 1])
        system.AddElement(beam_element)
        beams.append(beam_element)

# Set up the visualization using the Irrlicht engine
application = chronoirr.ChIrrApp(system, "Beam Finite Element Simulation", chronoirr.dimension2d(800, 600))
application.AddLogo()
application.AddSkyBox()
application.AddCamera(chronoirr.vector3df(0, 5, 10), chronoirr.vector3df(0, 0, 0))
application.AddLight(chronoirr.vector3df(0, 10, 10), chronoirr.SColorf(1, 1, 1))

# Create a mesh for visualization
for beam in beams:
    beam_mesh = chronoirr.ChIrrMesh(beam)
    application.AddMesh(beam_mesh)

# Set default parameters
gravity = chrono.ChVectorD(0, -9.81, 0)
system.Set_G_acc(gravity)

# Simulation loop
application.SetTimestep(0.01)  # Set the time step for the simulation
while application.GetDevice().run():
    application.BeginScene()
    application.DrawAll()
    application.EndScene()
    system.DoStepDynamics(application.GetTimestep())

# Clean up and exit
application.GetDevice().drop()
```

### Explanation of the Script:
1. **Initialization**: The script initializes the PyChrono environment and creates a physical system.
2. **Beam Mesh Creation**: It creates a series of nodes and connects them with beam elements. Each beam has properties such as diameter, Young's modulus, and density.
3. **Visualization Setup**: The Irrlicht engine is used for real-time rendering. A camera and light source are added for better visualization.
4. **Simulation Loop**: The simulation runs in a loop, updating the system at each time step and rendering the scene.

### Note:
- Make sure to replace `'/path/to/chrono/data/'` with the actual path to your Chrono data files.
- You may need to install the PyChrono library and its dependencies to run this script successfully.
- Adjust parameters such as beam properties, number of beams, and simulation time step as needed for your specific simulation requirements.

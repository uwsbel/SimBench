### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, mesh creation, node and element addition, force application, visualization setup, and simulation loop. 
   - **Deductions**: None.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code uses the PyChrono API correctly in most instances. However, there is a minor issue with the initialization of the nodes. The reference code uses `chrono.ChFrame` while the provided code uses `chrono.ChFrame` as well, but it is consistent. 
   - **Deductions**: None.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable. However, there are some minor formatting inconsistencies, such as spacing around operators and inconsistent comment styles.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for minor formatting issues.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code is efficient and does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It uses the `ChBuilderBeamEuler` class effectively to create beams.
   - **Deductions**: None.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any explicit error handling mechanisms. While this is not strictly necessary for a simple simulation, it could be improved for robustness.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is done correctly, and the code includes appropriate visual shapes for the FEA mesh. However, there are minor issues with the lighting setup that could be improved.
   - **Deductions**: 2 points for minor visualization issues.

### Summary of Deductions
- **Completeness**: 0 points
- **Correctness**: 0 points
- **Code Quality**: -5 points
- **Efficiency**: 0 points
- **Error Handling and Robustness**: -5 points
- **Use of Visualization Tools**: -2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total deductions: 5 + 5 + 2 = 12 points
- Final score: 100 - 12 = 88

### Final Score
[[88]]

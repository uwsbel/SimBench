### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: The provided code is missing the creation of visual shapes for the hinge constraints and the box bodies, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Minor Omissions**: The reference script initializes a `chrono.ChBodyEasyBox` for the box bodies, while the provided code uses `chrono.ChBody()`, which is less efficient. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 + 5 = **20 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The provided code does not correctly initialize the hinge constraints with visual shapes, which could lead to a significant change in simulation behavior. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: The force applied to the front node of the beam is significantly higher in the provided code (-0.7) compared to the reference (-0.2). This is a logical error that can affect the simulation results, leading to a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 + 10 = **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured, but there are some areas where variable names could be more descriptive. However, it is still readable. A deduction of **5 points** is warranted for minor readability issues.
   - **Comments**: The provided code has fewer comments compared to the reference script, which provides better documentation of each step. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 + 5 = **10 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The provided code has some redundant calculations, such as repeatedly calculating positions for the box bodies and constraints. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are important for robustness. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The provided code does not include visual shapes for the hinge constraints and the box bodies, which are crucial for visualization. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 20 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
- **Total Points Deducted**: 20 + 25 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 5 = **70 points**
- **Final Score**: 100 - 70 = **30 points**

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script. There are no missing components, so no points are deducted here. 
   - **Score: 40**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code has a few discrepancies compared to the reference script:
     - The `braking_time` in the provided code is set to `0.6`, while in the reference it is `0.5`. This is a logical error that could affect the simulation behavior. **Deduction: 10 points.**
     - All other API usages appear correct and do not lead to significant changes in simulation behavior. 
   - **Score: 20**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, similar to the reference script. However, there are minor formatting inconsistencies (e.g., spacing around operators) that could be improved for better readability. **Deduction: 5 points.**
   - **Score: 5**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not exhibit any unnecessary calculations or inefficient API usage compared to the reference script. It appears to follow the same efficient structure. No deductions are warranted here.
   - **Score: 10**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks explicit error handling mechanisms, which are not present in the reference script either. However, there are no indications of common issues being addressed. **Deduction: 5 points.**
   - **Score: 0**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is consistent with the reference script. However, the provided code does not include any additional visual elements or optimizations that are present in the reference. **Deduction: 2 points for minor visualization issues.**
   - **Score: 3**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points deducted
- Correctness: 10 points deducted
- Code Quality: 5 points deducted
- Efficiency: 0 points deducted
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points deducted
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points deducted

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a total of 100 points:
- 100 - 10 (Correctness) - 5 (Code Quality) - 5 (Error Handling) - 2 (Visualization) = 78

### Final Score
[[78]]

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components: system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. However, there are minor deviations in the way the custom force functor is implemented compared to the reference script.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - **5 points** for minor deviations in the implementation of the custom force functor (e.g., method naming conventions).
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code correctly initializes the system, bodies, and springs. However, the custom force functor does not match the expected parameters as per the reference script. The reference uses a different method signature for the force calculation.
   - **Deductions**:
     - **15 points** for incorrect use of the PyChrono API in the custom force functor, which could lead to a significant change in simulation behavior.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable. However, there are some areas where comments could be improved to enhance understanding, especially around the custom force functor.
   - **Deductions**:
     - **5 points** for insufficient comments and documentation compared to the reference script.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code is efficient and does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows the reference script closely in terms of efficiency.
   - **Total Deductions**: 0 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks explicit error handling, which is not present in the reference script either. However, it would benefit from checks or assertions to ensure that the bodies and links are initialized correctly.
   - **Deductions**:
     - **5 points** for lack of basic error handling.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is correctly implemented and closely follows the reference script. There are no significant issues in this area.
   - **Total Deductions**: 0 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 0 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 30 points
- Final Score: 100 - 30 = 70

**Final Score**: [[70]]

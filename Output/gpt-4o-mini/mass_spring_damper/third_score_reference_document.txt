### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided script is mostly complete but has some deviations from the reference script.
   - **Missing Essential Components**: The positions of `body_2` and `body_3` in the provided script are incorrect compared to the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Minor Omissions**: The reference script uses `chrono.ChFramed` for visual shape attachment, while the provided script uses `chrono.ChFrame`, which is a minor deviation. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 + 5 = **20 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The initialization of springs between bodies is incorrect in terms of the body references used in the provided script. The reference script correctly initializes the springs between the appropriate bodies. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: The provided script initializes the springs with incorrect body references, which could lead to significant changes in simulation behavior. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 + 10 = **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally readable and structured well, but it lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of each section and the parameters used. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided script does not exhibit any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, there are minor opportunities for optimization that are not utilized. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **3 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided script does not include any error handling or robustness checks, which are not present in the reference script either. However, it could benefit from basic error handling. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the title of the window in the provided script is less descriptive than in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **2 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **2 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 20 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
The initial score is 100 points. After applying the deductions:
- Total Deductions: 20 + 25 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 2 = **60 points**
- Final Score: 100 - 60 = **40 points**

### Final Score Output
[[40]]

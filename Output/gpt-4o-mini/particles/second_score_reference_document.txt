### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script, such as system initialization, body creation, visualization setup, and particle emitter configuration. Therefore, no points are deducted here.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code correctly uses the PyChrono API for the most part. However, there is a minor logical error in the energy calculations where the potential energy calculation could be improved for clarity and efficiency. The variable `G_constant` is defined inside the loop, which is unnecessary since it does not change during the simulation. This could lead to confusion and is not optimal.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted for minor inaccuracies.**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of various sections, especially in the simulation loop. The reference script provides better documentation in this regard.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted for insufficient comments.**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code has some redundancy, particularly in the way gravitational attraction is calculated twice (once for energy calculation and once for force application). This could be optimized by combining these calculations.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted for unnecessary calculations.**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for edge cases, such as ensuring that the number of bodies is sufficient before performing operations that assume at least two bodies exist. The reference script does not explicitly handle this either, but it is a common best practice.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted for lack of basic error handling.**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct and follows the reference script closely. However, there are minor deviations in the lighting setup and the addition of visual elements that could be improved for better visual quality.
   - **Score: 3 points deducted for minor visualization issues.**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points
- Correctness: 5 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Total Score Calculation
Total points deducted: 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 28 points

Starting from a perfect score of 100:
100 - 28 = 72

### Final Score
[[72]]

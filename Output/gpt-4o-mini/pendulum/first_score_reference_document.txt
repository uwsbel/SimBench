### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The provided code does not set the gravitational acceleration for the system, which is present in the reference script. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - The ground body in the reference script is created as a `ChBody` and has collision disabled, while the provided code uses `ChBodyEasyBox` without explicitly disabling collision. **(Deduct 10 points)**
     - The reference script includes a visual representation for the ground (a cylinder), which is absent in the provided code. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 40 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: 
     - The provided code uses `ChBodyEasyBox` for the pendulum, which is less flexible than using `ChBody` as in the reference. This could lead to issues in more complex simulations. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The pendulum's inertia is set using a formula, but the reference script sets it directly. The inertia tensor should be set with consideration of the actual shape of the pendulum. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The provided code is relatively readable, but it lacks comments explaining the purpose of various sections, which the reference script does well. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The provided code sets the pendulum's position twice, which is redundant. The initial position is set when creating the pendulum and again before the simulation loop. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the simulation state, which could lead to issues if the simulation fails to initialize properly. The reference script has more robust handling. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code lacks the detailed visualization setup present in the reference script, such as adding a logo, skybox, and typical lights. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
- **Total Points Deducted**: 40 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 85 points
- **Final Score**: 100 - 85 = 15 points

### Final Score Output

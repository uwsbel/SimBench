### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code is mostly complete but has some discrepancies compared to the reference script:
     - **Missing Component**: The reference uses a spherical joint (`ChLinkMateSpherical`), while the provided code uses `ChLinkLockSpherical`, which is not a direct equivalent. This is a significant difference in terms of functionality. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - **Minor Omissions**: The reference script uses `ChVisualShapeSphere` for the ground, while the provided code uses `ChVisualShapeCylinder`. This is a minor deviation but still affects the visual representation. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 20 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The provided code uses `pend_1.SetWvel_par` to set the initial angular velocity, while the reference uses `pend_1.SetPosDt`, which is more appropriate for setting the initial velocity of the pendulum. This could lead to significant differences in simulation behavior. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors**: The joint initialization in the provided code does not match the reference. The reference uses `chrono.ChLinkMateSpherical` with a quaternion, while the provided code uses `chrono.ChLinkLockSpherical` without a quaternion. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but there are some minor issues:
     - The variable names are clear, but the comments could be more descriptive in some places, especially regarding the purpose of certain settings. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The time step in the simulation loop is set to `1e-3`, while the reference uses `1e-2`. This could lead to unnecessary computations and inefficiency. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: 5 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for potential issues during the simulation loop. The reference script does not explicitly handle errors either, but it is generally good practice to include basic checks. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the use of `ChVisualShapeCylinder` for the ground instead of `ChVisualShapeSphere` is a deviation from the reference. **(Deduct 3 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools**: 3 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 20 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
- Total Points Deducted: 63 points
- Starting Score: 100 points
- Final Score: 100 - 63 = 37 points

### Final Score Output

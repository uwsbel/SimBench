### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. However, there are minor deviations:
     - The value of `CH_PI` is incorrectly set to `3.141592653589793` instead of `3.1456` as in the reference script. This is a significant detail for physical accuracy.
     - The comments in the reference script are more detailed, providing context for certain sections of the code.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for minor deviations.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The use of the PyChrono API is mostly correct, but there are some inaccuracies:
     - The custom motor function `ChFunctionMyFun` in the provided code does not match the reference implementation, which could lead to different simulation behavior.
     - The `SetMotorFunction` method is correctly called, but the function itself does not align with the reference, which may affect the motor's behavior.
   - **Deductions**: 15 points for incorrect use of the API (motor function).

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks some comments that would help clarify the purpose of certain sections. The reference script provides better documentation.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not show any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, there are minor opportunities for optimization that are not utilized.
   - **Deductions**: 3 points for missing obvious optimization opportunities.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks explicit error handling, which is not addressed in the reference script either. However, it does not account for potential issues that could arise during execution.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of basic error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is largely consistent with the reference script, but there are minor differences in the configuration of visual elements.
   - **Deductions**: 2 points for minor visualization issues.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 35 points
- Final Score: 100 - 35 = 65

Thus, the final score for the provided PyChrono code is: 

[[65]]

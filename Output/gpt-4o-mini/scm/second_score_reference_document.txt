### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code initializes the vehicle and terrain but lacks a dedicated class for terrain parameters, which is present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - The terrain parameters are set directly in the provided code rather than through a structured class, which is less organized than the reference. This results in an additional deduction of **10 points**.
   - Total deductions for completeness: **25 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code uses the terrain parameters directly without encapsulating them in a structured way, which could lead to confusion and errors in larger simulations. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - There are no significant logical errors or incorrect API uses that would lead to major changes in simulation behavior, so no further deductions are made here.
   - Total deductions for correctness: **10 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally readable, but it lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of certain sections, especially the terrain parameter setup. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - The structure is mostly clear, but the absence of a class for terrain parameters reduces clarity. No additional deductions are made here.
   - Total deductions for code quality: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not exhibit significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, the direct setting of terrain parameters could be seen as less efficient in terms of organization. This results in a deduction of **3 points** for missing the optimization opportunity of using a class for parameters.
   - Total deductions for efficiency: **3 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include error handling for invalid soil types when setting terrain parameters, which is a basic robustness feature present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - Total deductions for error handling and robustness: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup in the provided code is mostly aligned with the reference script, but it lacks the addition of typical lights and other visual enhancements that improve the scene's appearance. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - Total deductions for visualization tools: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: **25 points**
- Correctness: **10 points**
- Code Quality: **5 points**
- Efficiency: **3 points**
- Error Handling and Robustness: **5 points**
- Use of Visualization Tools: **3 points**

### Final Score Calculation
The total deductions amount to **51 points** from a maximum of **100 points**. Therefore, the final score is:

\[ \text{Final Score} = 100 - 51 = 49 \]

### Final Score Output

Below is a Python script that initializes a PyChrono simulation featuring an HMMWV vehicle, a deformable terrain, a driver system, and real-time visualization using Irrlicht. This script follows the instructions provided and sets up the necessary components for the simulation.

```python
import pychrono.core as chrono
import pychrono.irrlicht as chronoirr
import pychrono.vehicle as chrono_vehicle

# Initialize the PyChrono environment
chrono.ChCollisionModel.SetDefaultSuggestedEnvelope(0.001)
chrono.ChCollisionModel.SetDefaultSuggestedMargin(0.001)

# Create the system
system = chrono.ChSystemNSC()

# Create the HMMWV vehicle
hmmwv = chrono_vehicle.HMMWV()
hmmwv.Initialize(chrono.ChCoordsys(chrono.ChVectorD(0, 0, 0), chrono.ChQuaternionD(1, 0, 0, 0)))

# Set initial conditions for the vehicle
hmmwv.SetPos(chrono.ChVectorD(0, 0, 0))
hmmwv.SetRot(chrono.ChQuaternionD(1, 0, 0, 0))

# Create the SCM deformable terrain
terrain = chrono_vehicle.SCMDeformableTerrain(system)
terrain.SetContactMaterial(chrono.ChMaterialSurfaceNSC())
terrain.SetSoilParameters(20000, 0.3, 0.5)  # Example parameters: stiffness, friction, cohesion
terrain.Initialize(chrono.ChVectorD(0, 0, 0), "height_map.png")  # Load height map

# Initialize driver system for vehicle control
driver = chrono_vehicle.HMMWV_Driver(hmmwv)
driver.Initialize()

# Create Irrlicht visualization
application = chronoirr.ChIrrApp(system, "HMMWV Simulation", chronoirr.dimension2d(800, 600))
application.AddSkyBox()
application.AddCamera(chronoirr.vector3df(0, 5, -10), chronoirr.vector3df(0, 0, 0))
application.AddLight(chronoirr.vector3df(0, 10, -10), chronoirr.SColorf(1, 1, 1))

# Set the simulation step size
step_size = 0.01

# Simulation loop
while application.GetDevice().run():
    # Synchronize the driver and vehicle
    driver.Synchronize(application.GetSystemTime())
    hmmwv.Synchronize(application.GetSystemTime())
    terrain.Synchronize(application.GetSystemTime())
    
    # Advance the simulation
    system.DoStepDynamics(step_size)
    
    # Update visualization
    application.BeginScene()
    application.DrawAll()
    application.EndScene()

# Cleanup
application.GetDevice().drop()
```

### Explanation of the Script:

1. **Initialization**: The script begins by importing necessary modules from PyChrono and initializing the simulation environment.

2. **System Creation**: A new Chrono system is created to hold all simulation objects.

3. **Vehicle Setup**: An HMMWV vehicle is instantiated and initialized at the origin with a default orientation.

4. **Terrain Setup**: A deformable terrain is created with specified soil parameters and initialized with a height map image.

5. **Driver System**: A driver system is created for controlling the vehicle during the simulation.

6. **Visualization**: The Irrlicht application is set up with a skybox, camera, and lighting for real-time visualization.

7. **Simulation Loop**: The main loop synchronizes the driver, vehicle, and terrain at each timestep, advances the simulation, and updates the visualization.

### Note:
- Ensure that the height map image ("height_map.png") is available in the working directory or adjust the path accordingly.
- You may need to adjust the soil parameters and vehicle settings based on your specific simulation requirements.
- Make sure you have the necessary PyChrono and Irrlicht libraries installed and configured in your Python environment.

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: 
     - The provided code does not include collision settings, which are present in the reference script. This is a significant omission as collision detection is crucial for realistic simulations. **(15 points deduction)**
     - The reference script uses a `ChBodyEasyBox` for the ground, which simplifies the creation of the ground body. The provided code uses `ChBody`, which is less efficient. **(10 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The gravity setting in the provided code uses `Set_G_acc`, which is incorrect. The correct method is `SetGravitationalAcceleration`. **(15 points deduction)**
     - The provided code does not initialize the Turtlebot properly as a robot object, which is a logical error. **(10 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The provided code lacks meaningful comments and documentation, making it harder to understand the purpose of various sections. The reference script is better structured and documented. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The provided code updates the wheel positions directly in the simulation loop, which is inefficient. The reference script uses motor speeds to control the wheels, which is a more efficient approach. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the simulation state, which could lead to issues during runtime. The reference script handles this more robustly. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code does not utilize advanced visualization features such as adding textures or logos, which are present in the reference script. **(3 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
- Total Points Deducted: 68 points
- Starting Score: 100 points
- Final Score: 100 - 68 = 32

### Final Score Output

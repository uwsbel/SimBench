### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points
- Correctness: 0 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Total Points Deducted: 16 points  
Maximum Points: 100  
Final Score: 100 - 16 = 84

### Final Score Output
[[84]] 

### Explanation of Deductions
The code is well-structured and correctly implements the PyChrono API for the most part, with no significant errors in functionality. However, it lacks detailed comments, basic error handling, and could benefit from minor optimizations in random box placement and visualization enhancements. These factors contributed to the deductions.

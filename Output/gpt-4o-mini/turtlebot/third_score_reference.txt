### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code lacks the detailed lidar sensor configuration present in the reference script, such as the update rate, number of samples, field of view, and other parameters. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
     - The boxes created in the provided code are not fixed, whereas the reference script fixes them. This is another essential detail that is missing, leading to an additional deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of PyChrono API (15 points each)**: 
     - The lidar sensor in the provided code is not configured correctly compared to the reference. It lacks the necessary parameters and setup, which could lead to significant differences in simulation behavior. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors (10 points)**: 
     - The initial position of the robot in the provided code is set to (0, 0.2, 0), while the reference script sets it to (5, 0.0, 0). This could affect the robot's interaction with the environment. This leads to a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 to 10 points)**: 
     - The code is generally readable, but it lacks some structure in terms of grouping related functionalities together. However, it is not severely lacking, so a deduction of **5 points** is appropriate.
   - **Comments and Documentation (5 points)**: 
     - While there are comments present, they are not as detailed as in the reference script. The reference script provides better documentation for the lidar setup and other components. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 10 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations or Redundant Code (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code has a simple movement function that could be optimized. The reference script has a more nuanced control of the robot's movement. This leads to a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling for the movement function, whereas the reference script raises a ValueError for invalid modes. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 to 5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not enable shadows, which is commented out for performance. The reference script does not have this comment, indicating a more complete setup. This leads to a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 25 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 78 points
- Final Score: 100 - 78 = 22 points

### Final Score Output

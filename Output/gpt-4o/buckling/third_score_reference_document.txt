### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The output directory is set to "BEAM_FAILED" instead of a more appropriate name like "BEAM_BUCKLING" as in the reference. This could be considered a minor omission. **(5 points deduction)**
     - The reference script uses `ChLinkMotorRotationAngle` instead of `ChLinkMotorRotationSpeed`, which could affect the simulation behavior. **(10 points deduction)**
     - The reference script has a different number of elements in the IGA beam and vertical beam, which may lead to different simulation results. **(10 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The motor initialization and function setting are incorrect. The reference uses `SetAngleFunction` instead of `SetSpeedFunction`. **(15 points deduction)**
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The dimensions and properties of the beams differ from the reference, which could lead to significant differences in simulation results. **(10 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but the variable names could be more descriptive in some cases. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Comments**: 
     - The comments are adequate but could be improved for clarity and detail, especially in complex sections. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 10 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The code has some redundant calculations and could be optimized further, particularly in the way vectors are defined and used. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The script does not include any error handling or checks for potential issues that could arise during execution. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: 
     - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the window size and title differ from the reference, which may affect user experience. **(3 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 73 points
- Final Score: 100 - 73 = 27 points

### Final Score Output

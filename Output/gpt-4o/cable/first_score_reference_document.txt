### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks the use of a mesh container (`ChMesh`) and the utility class `ChBuilderCableANCF` for building the beam structure, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Boundary Conditions**: The boundary conditions (constraints) are not as clearly defined as in the reference script, which applies a force to the front node. This results in an additional deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Visualization Details**: The visualization setup is less comprehensive compared to the reference script, which includes specific visual shapes for the beam and nodes. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 15 + 10 + 5 = **30 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The provided code uses `ChBody()` instead of `ChBodyEasySphere` or `ChBodyEasyBox` for creating bodies, which is less efficient and not aligned with best practices. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: The beam's Young's modulus and density values are not consistent with typical values for a beam simulation, which could lead to unrealistic simulation behavior. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 15 + 10 = **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is relatively well-structured but lacks meaningful comments explaining the purpose of various sections, which is a significant aspect of code quality. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Redundant Code**: The code contains some redundancy in the way nodes and elements are created and added to the system. The reference script uses a builder utility that streamlines this process. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the successful initialization of the system or visualization, which is a common practice in robust simulations. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is basic and does not include advanced features like visual shapes for the beam and nodes, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = **73 points**
- Final Score: 100 - 73 = **27 points**

### Final Score Output

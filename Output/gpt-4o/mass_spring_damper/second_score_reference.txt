### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. However, there are some minor deviations:
     - The `ChSphereShape` and `ChBoxShape` are used instead of `ChVisualShapeSphere` and `ChVisualShapeBox`, which are more appropriate for visualization. This results in a deduction of **5 points** for minor deviations.
   - **Total Deductions: 5 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly initializes the system and bodies, but there are some issues:
     - The `Set_G_acc` method is used instead of `SetGravitationalAcceleration`, which is a minor API inconsistency. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
     - The `SetBodyFixed` method is used instead of `SetFixed`, which is another minor API inconsistency. This results in another deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions: 10 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally readable and well-structured, but the comments could be more informative. The reference script provides better documentation practices. This results in a deduction of **5 points** for insufficient comments.
   - **Total Deductions: 5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not have significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, the use of `ChSphereShape` and `ChBoxShape` instead of their visual counterparts could be seen as a minor inefficiency. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions: 3 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling or robustness checks, which are not explicitly present in the reference script either. However, the reference script is more robust in its structure. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions: 5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the use of `ChSphereShape` instead of `ChVisualShapeSphere` is a minor issue. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions: 3 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 10 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 5 + 10 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 3 = 31 points
- Final Score: 100 - 31 = 69

### Final Score
[[69]]

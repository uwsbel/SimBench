### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. However, there are minor deviations in the naming conventions and some details:
     - The `Set_G_acc` method is used instead of `SetGravitationalAcceleration`, which is the preferred method in the reference script. **(Deduct 5 points)**
     - The `AddVisualShape` method for the sphere shapes uses `ChSphereShape`, while the reference uses `ChVisualShapeSphere`. This is a minor deviation but still a difference in the API usage. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions: 10 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly implements the spring-damper system and uses the custom force functor appropriately. However, there is a logical error in the `MySpringForce` class:
     - The `evaluate` method should use `self.spring_coef` and `self.damping_coef` directly instead of passing them as parameters. This could lead to confusion and incorrect behavior if the parameters are changed. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions: 10 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks some comments that could clarify the purpose of certain sections, especially around the initialization of bodies and springs. The reference script provides better documentation. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions: 5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit any unnecessary calculations or redundant code. However, the use of `chrono.ChSphereShape()` instead of `chrono.ChVisualShapeSphere()` for visualization could be considered less efficient in terms of clarity and intent. **(Deduct 3 points)**
   - **Total Deductions: 3 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, such as checking if the bodies are successfully added to the system or if the visualization initializes correctly. The reference script does not explicitly handle errors either, but it is generally a good practice to include basic checks. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions: 5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the use of `ChSphereShape` instead of `ChVisualShapeSphere` is a deviation from best practices. **(Deduct 3 points)**
   - **Total Deductions: 3 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 10 points
- Correctness: 10 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 36 points
- Final Score: 100 - 36 = 64

### Final Score Output

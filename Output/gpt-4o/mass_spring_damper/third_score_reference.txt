### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes the initialization of the system, creation of bodies, springs, and visualization setup. However, it lacks the creation of `body_2` and `body_3` in the same manner as the reference script, which has a more structured approach to body creation and visualization. The positions of `body_2` and `body_3` are also inconsistent with the reference script.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - Missing essential details in body creation and visualization (10 points).
     - Minor deviations in body positions (5 points).
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code uses the correct PyChrono API functions, but there are logical errors in the initialization of the springs. The reference script initializes springs between bodies in a specific order and with specific parameters that are not consistently followed in the provided code.
   - **Deductions**:
     - Incorrect initialization of springs (10 points).
     - Minor inaccuracies in body properties (5 points).
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is relatively readable, but it lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of each section, which the reference script does better. Variable names are generally clear, but some could be improved for clarity.
   - **Deductions**:
     - Insufficient comments (5 points).
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not exhibit any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, there are minor opportunities for optimization in how the bodies and springs are created.
   - **Deductions**:
     - Minor optimization opportunities missed (3 points).
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are essential for robustness. The reference script does not explicitly show error handling but is structured in a way that anticipates common issues.
   - **Deductions**:
     - Lack of basic error handling (5 points).
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is generally correct, but there are minor issues with the naming and clarity of the window title and other visual elements compared to the reference script.
   - **Deductions**:
     - Minor visualization issues (2 points).
   - **Total Deductions**: 2 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 15 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting with a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 15 + 15 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 45 points
- Final Score: 100 - 45 = 55 points

### Final Score Output
[[55]]

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code initializes the PyChrono environment, creates a physical system, and sets up visualization. However, it lacks the use of a collision system, which is present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - The particle emitter is implemented but does not utilize the more advanced features seen in the reference code, such as texture application and specific particle properties. This results in an additional deduction of **10 points**.
   - Total deductions: **25 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The gravitational force calculation is implemented correctly, but the gravitational constant used is significantly different (the reference uses a modified value). This leads to a deduction of **15 points**.
   - The method of applying forces is correct, but the way particles are created and added to the system lacks the efficiency and structure of the reference code. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - Total deductions: **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is relatively readable, but it lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of functions and key sections of the code. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - Total deductions: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code contains some redundant calculations, particularly in the gravitational force application, which could be optimized by using combinations as in the reference code. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - Total deductions: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for edge cases, such as ensuring that the distance between particles is not zero before applying forces. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - Total deductions: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is basic and lacks some features present in the reference code, such as texture application and advanced lighting. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - Total deductions: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total deductions: 25 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 68 points
- Final score: 100 - 68 = **32**

### Final Score

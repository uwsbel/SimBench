### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. However, there is a minor deviation in the `SetGeometry` method where the reference uses `chrono.ChFramed()` instead of `chrono.ChFrame()`. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Points Deducted: 5**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The use of the PyChrono API is mostly correct. However, there is a logical error in the order of energy calculations. The potential energy calculation should occur before the force accumulation, as it relies on the positions of the bodies. This leads to a deduction of **10 points**.
   - Additionally, the `GetPos_dt()` method is incorrectly used as `GetPos_dt()` instead of `GetPosDt()`, which is a minor inaccuracy. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Points Deducted: 15**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable. However, there are some minor issues with formatting and variable naming consistency. For example, the variable `mcreation_callback` could be more descriptively named. There are also some missing comments that could enhance understanding. Therefore, I will deduct **5 points**.
   - **Points Deducted: 5**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code contains some redundant calculations, particularly in the energy calculation section where the potential energy is calculated twice. This leads to a deduction of **5 points** for unnecessary calculations.
   - **Points Deducted: 5**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The code lacks basic error handling for potential issues such as division by zero in the gravitational force calculations. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Points Deducted: 5**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there is a minor issue with the lighting setup compared to the reference script. This results in a deduction of **2 points**.
   - **Points Deducted: 2**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
- Total Points Deducted: 37
- Maximum Points: 100
- Final Score: 100 - 37 = 63

### Final Score Output

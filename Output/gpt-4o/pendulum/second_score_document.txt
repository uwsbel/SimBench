### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

#### Completeness (40 points total)
- **System Initialization**: The script correctly initializes the Chrono simulation system and sets gravitational acceleration. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Body Creation**: Both the ground and pendulum bodies are created and added to the system. The ground is fixed, and the pendulum is movable. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Visualization**: Visualization components are added for both the ground and pendulum, including shapes and colors. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Joint Creation**: A spherical joint is created to connect the pendulum to the ground. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Simulation Loop**: The simulation loop is present and correctly structured. **(0 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Completeness: 0 points**

#### Correctness (30 points total)
- **API Usage**: The use of the PyChrono API appears correct, with no significant errors that would alter the simulation behavior. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Logical Errors**: The initialization of the spherical joint is done correctly, and the properties of the pendulum are set appropriately. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Minor Inaccuracies**: There are no unnecessary API calls or minor inaccuracies present. **(0 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Correctness: 0 points**

#### Code Quality (10 points total)
- **Readability and Structure**: The code is well-structured and easy to read. Variable names are meaningful, and the overall flow is logical. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Comments**: The code includes comments that explain the purpose of various sections and components. However, some comments could be more detailed. **(5 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Code Quality: 5 points**

#### Efficiency (10 points total)
- **Unnecessary Calculations**: There are no unnecessary calculations or redundant code present. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Optimization Opportunities**: The code could be optimized by adjusting the time step dynamically based on simulation needs, but this is not a critical issue. **(3 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Efficiency: 3 points**

#### Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)
- **Basic Error Handling**: There is no error handling present in the simulation loop or initialization, which could lead to issues if the simulation encounters unexpected states. **(5 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points**

#### Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)
- **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, with a window size, title, and camera position defined. However, the lighting could be enhanced for better visibility. **(3 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points**

### Final Score Calculation
- **Total Points Deducted**: 0 (Completeness) + 0 (Correctness) + 5 (Code Quality) + 3 (Efficiency) + 5 (Error Handling) + 3 (Visualization) = 16 points deducted
- **Final Score**: 100 - 16 = 84

### Final Score Output
[[84]] 

### Explanation of Deductions
- **Code Quality**: Minor deductions for comments that could be more descriptive.
- **Efficiency**: A small deduction for not dynamically adjusting the time step.
- **Error Handling**: Full deduction for lack of error handling, which is critical for robustness.
- **Visualization Tools**: Minor deduction for lighting setup that could be improved.

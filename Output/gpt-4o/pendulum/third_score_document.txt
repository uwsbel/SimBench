### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

#### Completeness (40 points total)
1. **System Initialization**: The system is initialized correctly with `chrono.ChSystemNSC()`, and gravitational acceleration is set appropriately. **(0 points deducted)**
2. **Body Creation**: Both the ground and pendulum bodies are created and configured correctly. **(0 points deducted)**
3. **Visualization Setup**: The visualization components are present, including the camera, lights, and skybox. **(0 points deducted)**
4. **Joint Creation**: The revolute joints connecting the pendulums are created and initialized correctly. **(0 points deducted)**
5. **Logging**: The logging mechanism is implemented, but it could be improved by allowing for more flexible logging options or conditions. **(5 points deducted for minor omission)**

**Total Deductions for Completeness: 5 points**

#### Correctness (30 points total)
1. **API Usage**: The API is used correctly throughout the script, with no significant errors in function calls or parameters. **(0 points deducted)**
2. **Logical Errors**: The initialization of joints and body properties appears correct, with no logical errors present. **(0 points deducted)**
3. **Minor Inaccuracies**: There are no unnecessary API calls or inaccuracies in the code. **(0 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Correctness: 0 points**

#### Code Quality (10 points total)
1. **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it could benefit from more consistent spacing and organization. **(5 points deducted for minor readability issues)**
2. **Comments**: While there are some comments, they could be more detailed to explain the purpose of certain sections or choices made in the code. **(5 points deducted for insufficient comments)**

**Total Deductions for Code Quality: 10 points**

#### Efficiency (10 points total)
1. **Unnecessary Calculations**: There are no unnecessary calculations or redundant code present. **(0 points deducted)**
2. **Optimization Opportunities**: The simulation loop could potentially be optimized by adjusting the time step based on the simulation state, but this is a minor point. **(3 points deducted for missing optimization opportunity)**

**Total Deductions for Efficiency: 3 points**

#### Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)
1. **Basic Error Handling**: There is no error handling implemented in the script, which could lead to issues if unexpected conditions arise during simulation. **(5 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points**

#### Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)
1. **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the addition of a logo could be improved by checking if the file exists before attempting to add it. **(3 points deducted for minor visualization issue)**

**Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points**

### Final Score Calculation
- Completeness: 5 points deducted
- Correctness: 0 points deducted
- Code Quality: 10 points deducted
- Efficiency: 3 points deducted
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points deducted
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points deducted

**Total Deductions: 26 points**

**Final Score: 100 - 26 = 74**

### Final Score Output
[[74]] 

### Brief Explanation of Deductions
- Minor omissions in logging and comments led to a deduction in completeness and code quality.
- Lack of error handling reduced the robustness of the script.
- Minor optimization opportunities were missed, affecting efficiency.
- Visualization setup was mostly correct but had a minor issue with logo handling.

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks the use of `ChSystemSMC()` which is present in the reference script. Instead, it uses `ChSystemNSC()`, which may not be suitable for all scenarios. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
     - The reference code includes automatic gravity settings and a more complex body setup, which are absent in the provided code. This results in an additional deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The provided code uses `ChLinkMateGeneric()` for the flywheel attachment, while the reference uses `ChLinkMateFix()`, which is more appropriate for fixed connections. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The motor initialization does not match the reference script's setup, which uses a sine function for motor speed instead of a constant speed. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The code is generally well-structured but lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of each section. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The provided code does not utilize the `ChBuilderBeamIGA()` tool for beam creation, which is more efficient than manually creating nodes and elements. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which could lead to issues during execution. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code lacks some visualization elements present in the reference script, such as specific visual shapes for the beam and flywheel. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 73 points
- Final Score: 100 - 73 = 27 points

### Final Score

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. However, there is a minor omission in the comments regarding the Rayleigh damping, which is set to a non-zero value in the reference script but is described as "zero" in the comments. 
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for minor omissions.
   - **Score**: 35/40

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly implements the main functionalities as per the reference script. However, there is a slight inconsistency in the comments regarding Rayleigh damping, which could lead to confusion about its actual value.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for minor inaccuracies in comments.
   - **Score**: 25/30

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is well-structured and readable. However, there are some areas where comments could be more descriptive, particularly in explaining the purpose of certain parameters or functions.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments.
   - **Score**: 5/10

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code is efficient and does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows the best practices outlined in the reference script.
   - **Score**: 10/10

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The code lacks explicit error handling mechanisms, such as checks for the successful creation of bodies or constraints. The reference script does not explicitly handle errors either, but it is a good practice to include such checks.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of basic error handling.
   - **Score**: 0/5

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct and follows the reference script closely. However, there are minor differences in the lighting setup and the addition of visual elements that could be optimized.
   - **Deductions**: 3 points for minor visualization issues.
   - **Score**: 2/5

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: -5 points
- Correctness: -5 points
- Code Quality: -5 points
- Error Handling: -5 points
- Visualization: -3 points

### Final Score Calculation
- Total Points: 40 + 30 + 10 + 10 + 5 + 5 = 100
- Deductions: 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 23
- Final Score: 100 - 23 = 77

### Final Score Output
[[77]]

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, visualization setup, and simulation loop. However, there are slight deviations in comments and descriptions compared to the reference script.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - **5 points** for minor omissions or slight deviations in comments and descriptions.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly initializes the system, bodies, and joints. However, there are minor inaccuracies in the comments and the way some components are described, which could lead to confusion.
   - **Deductions**:
     - **5 points** for minor inaccuracies in comments that could lead to misunderstanding.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks some detailed comments that would enhance understanding. The variable names are meaningful, but the overall documentation is less comprehensive than in the reference script.
   - **Deductions**:
     - **5 points** for insufficient comments or failure to follow documentation best practices.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit any unnecessary calculations or inefficient use of APIs compared to the reference script. It is efficient in its current form.
   - **Total Deductions**: 0 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any explicit error handling mechanisms. The reference script does not show significant error handling either, but it is generally more robust in its structure.
   - **Deductions**:
     - **5 points** for lack of basic error handling.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor issues with the comments that describe the visualization setup, which could lead to confusion.
   - **Deductions**:
     - **2 points** for minor visualization issues in comments.
   - **Total Deductions**: 2 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 5 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 5 + 5 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 2 = 22 points
- Final Score: 100 - 22 = 78

### Final Score Output
[[78]]

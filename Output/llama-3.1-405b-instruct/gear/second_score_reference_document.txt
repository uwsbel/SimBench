### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, visualization, and simulation loop. However, there are minor deviations in comments and descriptions compared to the reference script.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - **0 points** for missing components.
     - **5 points** for minor omissions or slight deviations in comments.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly uses the PyChrono API for the most part. However, there are a few areas where the initialization of joints and settings could lead to logical errors or misconfigurations.
   - **Deductions**:
     - **0 points** for incorrect API usage.
     - **10 points** for logical errors in joint initialization or body properties.
   - **Total Deductions**: 10 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks some comments that could enhance understanding, especially for complex parts like gear constraints.
   - **Deductions**:
     - **5 points** for insufficient comments.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit any unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows the reference script closely in terms of efficiency.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - **0 points** for efficiency issues.
   - **Total Deductions**: 0 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The code does not include any explicit error handling mechanisms, which could be beneficial for robustness.
   - **Deductions**:
     - **5 points** for lack of basic error handling.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct and follows the reference script closely. However, there are minor issues with the lighting setup and camera positioning that could be improved.
   - **Deductions**:
     - **2 points** for minor visualization issues.
   - **Total Deductions**: 2 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 10 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
- Total Points Deducted: 5 + 10 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 2 = 27 points
- Starting Score: 100 points
- Final Score: 100 - 27 = 73 points

### Final Score Output
[[73]]

### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code is mostly complete, but it lacks the drawing of segments for the pulley in the visualization loop, which is present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Minor Omissions**: The comment structure could be improved for clarity, but it is not a significant omission. Thus, no further deductions are made here.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The code uses `chrono.ChLinkLockGear()` correctly, but the initialization of the revolute joint for gear D and the truss is incorrect in terms of the frame of reference. The reference script uses a different orientation for the joint. This leads to a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: The code correctly initializes the gears and links, but the visual shape for gear D has a different height than in the reference, which could affect the simulation visually. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it could benefit from more descriptive comments and consistent formatting. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The code does not exhibit significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, there are minor opportunities for optimization in the way visual shapes are added. Thus, a deduction of **3 points** is warranted.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The script does not include any error handling or checks for potential issues during initialization or simulation. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but it lacks the drawing of segments for the pulley, which is present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 15 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 46 points
- Final Score: 100 - 46 = 54

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components (15 points each)**:
     - The provided code lacks the explicit setting of gravitational acceleration, which is present in the reference script. **(15 points)**
     - The ground body in the provided code is created as a box with specific dimensions, while the reference script uses a generic body and adds a visual shape. This is a significant deviation. **(15 points)**
     - The reference script includes a visualization asset for the spring, which is not present in the provided code. **(15 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 45 points (exceeds 40, capped at 40).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API (15 points each)**:
     - The provided code uses `ChBodyEasyBox` and `ChBodyEasySphere`, which are higher-level abstractions that may not be appropriate for all use cases. The reference script uses `ChBody`, which is more flexible and allows for better control over properties. **(15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors (10 points)**:
     - The initialization of the spring connection in the provided code does not match the reference script's initialization, which could lead to different simulation behaviors. **(10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 to 10 points)**:
     - The provided code is relatively readable, but variable names could be more descriptive. **(5 points)**
   - **Insufficient Comments (5 points)**:
     - The provided code lacks comments explaining the purpose of various sections, which are present in the reference script. **(5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: 10 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations or Redundant Code (5 points)**:
     - The provided code has a more complex setup for the ground body compared to the reference script, which could be simplified. **(5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: 5 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling (5 points)**:
     - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, while the reference script has a more robust setup. **(5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 to 5 points)**:
     - The provided code does not include a logo or a skybox in the visualization setup, which are present in the reference script. **(5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: 5 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 40 + 25 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 90 points
- Final Score: 100 - 90 = 10

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code is mostly complete but has some deviations from the reference script.
   - **Missing Essential Components**: The reference script has a different configuration for the positions of `body_2` and `body_3`, which are positioned at `(-1, -6, 0)` and `(-1, -9, 0)` respectively, while the provided code positions them at `(1, -3, 0)` and `(3, -3, 0)`. This change affects the physical setup of the simulation.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - 15 points for the incorrect positioning of `body_2` and `body_3`.
     - 10 points for the incorrect initialization of springs (the reference script connects `spring_2` to `body_1` and `body_2` correctly, while the provided code does not).
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code uses the PyChrono API correctly in most instances, but there are logical errors.
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The initialization of springs does not match the reference script's logic, which could lead to different simulation behavior.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - 15 points for the incorrect initialization of `spring_2` and `spring_3`.
     - 10 points for the logical error in the spring connections.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks comments that explain the purpose of various components.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - 5 points for insufficient comments.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code, and it follows the reference script's structure closely.
   - **Deductions**: None.
   - **Total Deductions**: 0 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which could be important for robustness.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - 5 points for lack of error handling.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor differences in the window title and the way the visualization is structured.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - 3 points for minor visualization issues (e.g., window title).
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a total of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 25 + 25 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 3 = 63 points
- Final Score: 100 - 63 = 37

### Final Score Output
[[37]]

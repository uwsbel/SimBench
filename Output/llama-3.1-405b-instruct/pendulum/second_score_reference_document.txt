### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The reference script uses `SetGravitationalAcceleration` instead of `Set_G_acc`, which is a minor but important difference. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
     - The ground body visualization uses a sphere in the reference script, while the provided code uses a cylinder. This is a significant difference in the visual representation, leading to a deduction of **10 points**.
     - The pendulum body is added using `sys.AddBody(pend_1)` in the reference, while the provided code uses `sys.Add(pend_1)`, which is less specific. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: **20 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: 
     - The provided code uses `Set_G_acc` instead of `SetGravitationalAcceleration`, which is incorrect and could lead to simulation issues. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
     - The pendulum's initial angular velocity is set using `SetWvel_loc`, which is not the correct method as per the reference. The reference uses `SetPosDt`, leading to a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code is generally well-structured but lacks some clarity in variable naming (e.g., `cyl_1` is reused for both ground and pendulum). This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Comments**: The provided code has sufficient comments, but some could be more descriptive. However, it is comparable to the reference. No deduction here.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The provided code uses a time step of `1e-3` in `sys.DoStepDynamics`, while the reference uses `1e-2`, which is less efficient for the same simulation duration. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are not explicitly present in the reference either. However, the reference is more robust in its structure. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The provided code has a good setup for visualization, but it lacks the specific visual elements (like the correct shape for the ground) that the reference script implements. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools**: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 20 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
- Total Points Deducted: 63 points
- Starting Score: 100 points
- Final Score: 100 - 63 = 37

### Final Score Output

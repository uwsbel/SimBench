### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script. Therefore, no deductions are made here.
   - **Configuration Issues**: The configuration of the components appears to be correct and matches the reference script. No deductions.
   - **Minor Omissions**: There are no significant minor omissions or deviations. No deductions.

   **Total Deductions for Completeness: 0 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of PyChrono API**: The provided code uses the PyChrono API correctly, and there are no significant changes in simulation behavior compared to the reference script. No deductions.
   - **Logical Errors**: There are no logical errors in the code. All joints and bodies are initialized correctly. No deductions.
   - **Minor Inaccuracies**: There are no minor inaccuracies or unnecessary API calls that deviate from the reference script. No deductions.

   **Total Deductions for Correctness: 0 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is well-structured and readable, similar to the reference script. No deductions.
   - **Comments and Documentation**: The comments are sufficient, but there could be more detailed explanations in some areas. Deducting 5 points for slightly insufficient comments compared to the reference.

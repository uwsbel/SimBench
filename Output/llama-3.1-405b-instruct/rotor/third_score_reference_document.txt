### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code is mostly complete, but it lacks the definition of the custom motor function in the same way as the reference script. Instead, it defines the function as a class, which is a deviation from the reference. 
   - **Deductions**: 
     - Missing essential component: 15 points (for the custom motor function).
     - Minor deviation in the motor function implementation: 5 points.
   - **Total Deductions**: 20 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code has a few inaccuracies:
     - The `CH_PI` constant is defined as `3.1456`, which is not accurate. The correct value should be `math.pi`.
     - The motor function parameters and behavior differ from the reference, which could lead to different simulation results.
   - **Deductions**:
     - Incorrect use of a constant: 15 points.
     - Logical error in motor function implementation: 10 points.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable. However, there are some areas where comments could be more descriptive, particularly around the custom motor function.
   - **Deductions**:
     - Lack of meaningful comments in some areas: 5 points.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not appear to have any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, the use of `math.floor()` could be replaced with integer division for clarity.
   - **Deductions**:
     - Minor optimization opportunity: 3 points.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which could be important for robustness in a simulation context.
   - **Deductions**:
     - Lack of basic error handling: 5 points.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly consistent with the reference script, but there are minor differences in the way visual elements are added.
   - **Deductions**:
     - Minor visualization issues: 2 points.
   - **Total Deductions**: 2 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 20 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 20 + 25 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 60 points
- Final Score: 100 - 60 = 40

Thus, the final score for the provided PyChrono code is:

[[40]]

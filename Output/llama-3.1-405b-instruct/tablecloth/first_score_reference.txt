### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code does not create an output directory for simulation results, which is present in the reference script. **(15 points deduction)**
     - The reference script uses a `ChMesh` object to manage nodes and elements, while the provided code does not use a mesh object, which is a significant omission. **(15 points deduction)**
   - **Incorrect Configuration (10 points)**: 
     - The provided code uses `ChSystemNSC()` instead of `ChSystemSMC()`, which may affect the simulation behavior. **(10 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 40 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Use (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code uses `ChBodyEasyMesh` which is not appropriate for this context as it does not align with the reference's use of `ChNodeFEAxyz` and `ChElementShellBST`. **(15 points deduction)**
   - **Logical Errors (10 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not set up the mesh correctly, leading to potential issues in simulation dynamics. **(10 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 to 10 points)**: 
     - The code is relatively readable, but lacks meaningful comments and documentation compared to the reference script. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations (5 points)**: 
     - The code creates nodes and elements in a less efficient manner compared to the reference script's structured approach. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling for potential issues such as file creation or simulation setup, which is present in the reference script. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 to 5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not include the same level of detail in visualization setup as the reference script, particularly in terms of visualizing the mesh and elements. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: 5 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
- **Total Points Deducted**: 40 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 85 points
- **Starting Score**: 100 points
- **Final Score**: 100 - 85 = 15 points

### Final Score Output

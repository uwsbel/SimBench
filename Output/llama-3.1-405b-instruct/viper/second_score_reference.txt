### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script. There are no missing components, and all necessary elements for the simulation are included. 
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code correctly uses the PyChrono API and does not contain significant errors that would lead to a change in simulation behavior. 
   - There are no logical errors or incorrect settings of body properties compared to the reference script.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is structured well, with meaningful variable names and consistent formatting. However, there are some minor comments that could be improved for clarity, particularly in areas where the logic is more complex.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted for insufficient comments.**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code is efficient and does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows the same structure as the reference script without introducing inefficiencies.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks explicit error handling mechanisms that could account for potential issues during the simulation. The reference script does not explicitly handle errors either, but it is generally good practice to include basic error handling in simulation scripts.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted for lack of error handling.**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup in the provided code is adequate and closely follows the reference script. However, the line for enabling shadows is commented out, which may affect the visual quality of the simulation.
   - **Score: 3 points deducted for inadequate visualization setup (commented out shadows).**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points
- Correctness: 0 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
The total deductions amount to 13 points. The maximum score is 100 points, so the final score is:

100 - 13 = 87

**Final Score: [[87]]**

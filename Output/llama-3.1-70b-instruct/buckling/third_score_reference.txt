### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks the initialization of the truss body as a fixed body and the corresponding visualization shape, which is present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
     - The output directory name differs from the reference script, which could lead to confusion. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Incorrect Configuration**: 
     - The motor type used in the provided code is `ChLinkMotorRotationSpeed`, while the reference uses `ChLinkMotorRotationAngle`. This could lead to significant differences in behavior. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: **30 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The provided code uses `SetTorqueFunction` instead of `SetAngleFunction` for the motor, which is incorrect. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The dimensions and properties of the beams differ from the reference script, which may lead to incorrect simulation behavior. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The code is generally well-structured, but some variable names could be more descriptive. There are also minor formatting inconsistencies. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Comments**: 
     - The comments are mostly adequate, but some sections could benefit from additional clarification. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **10 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - There are instances of redundant calculations or inefficient use of APIs compared to the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Missing Optimizations**: 
     - The provided code does not implement some optimizations present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **8 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which could lead to issues during execution. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: 
     - The visualization setup is less comprehensive compared to the reference script, particularly in terms of lighting and visual elements. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 8 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Deductions: 30 + 25 + 10 + 8 + 5 + 3 = 81 points
- Final Score: 100 - 81 = 19

### Final Score Output

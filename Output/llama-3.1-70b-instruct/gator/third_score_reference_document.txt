### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script, such as system initialization, vehicle creation, and visualization setup. Therefore, no points are deducted in this category.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code has a logical error in the `steering_time`, `throttle_time`, and `braking_time` settings. The reference script uses values of `2.0`, `2.0`, and `0.5`, respectively, while the provided code uses `5.0`, `5.0`, and `1.5`. This discrepancy could lead to a significant change in simulation behavior. Thus, **15 points** are deducted for incorrect use of the API.
   - No other significant logical errors or incorrect settings were found, so no additional deductions are made in this category.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. However, it lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of certain sections, especially in the simulation loop. Therefore, **5 points** are deducted for insufficient comments.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit any unnecessary calculations or redundant code compared to the reference script. However, there are minor optimization opportunities that could be implemented, such as consolidating similar API calls. Therefore, **3 points** are deducted for missing obvious optimization opportunities.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms or checks for potential issues during execution, which the reference script may handle. Therefore, **5 points** are deducted for lack of basic error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the provided code does not include the `vis.AddTypicalLights()` function, which is present in the reference script. This omission affects the quality of the visualization. Therefore, **3 points** are deducted for inadequate visualization setup.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points deducted
- Correctness: 15 points deducted
- Code Quality: 5 points deducted
- Efficiency: 3 points deducted
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points deducted
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points deducted

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total deductions: 15 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 3 = 31 points
- Final score: 100 - 31 = 69

Thus, the final score for the provided simulation script is: [[69]]

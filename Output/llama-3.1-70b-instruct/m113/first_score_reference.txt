### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code lacks the initialization of the vehicle's driveline, engine, and transmission types, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of 15 points.
     - The terrain is not initialized with a texture or color, which is also present in the reference script. This results in another deduction of 15 points.
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code uses `chrono.ChBodyEasyBox` for terrain creation, which is not the same as the `veh.RigidTerrain` used in the reference. This could lead to significant differences in simulation behavior. Deduct 15 points.
   - **Logical Errors (10 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not set the collision system type for the vehicle, which is specified in the reference script. Deduct 10 points.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 to 10 points)**: 
     - The code lacks meaningful comments and documentation, making it less readable compared to the reference script. Deduct 5 points.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code redundantly sets visualization options multiple times (e.g., `SetShowInfos`, `SetShowCollisionModels`, etc.). This could be optimized. Deduct 5 points.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or robustness checks, which are present in the reference script. Deduct 5 points.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 to 5 points)**: 
     - The visualization setup in the provided code is less comprehensive than in the reference script, which includes specific camera tracking and lighting setups. Deduct 3 points.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 73 points
- Final Score: 100 - 73 = 27 points

### Final Score Output

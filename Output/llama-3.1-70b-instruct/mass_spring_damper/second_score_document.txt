### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **System Initialization**: The system is correctly initialized with `chrono.ChSystemNSC()`. (0 points deducted)
   - **Body Creation**: Both bodies and springs are created and added to the system. (0 points deducted)
   - **Visualization**: The visualization setup is complete with a window, camera, and lights. (0 points deducted)
   - **Missing Components**: No essential components are missing. (0 points deducted)
   - **Total Deductions**: 0 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: The use of `chrono.ChLinkTSDA` for the spring connections is appropriate, and the custom force functor is correctly implemented. (0 points deducted)
   - **Logical Errors**: The initialization of bodies and springs appears correct, with no logical errors present. (0 points deducted)
   - **Total Deductions**: 0 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is well-structured, with meaningful variable names and clear organization. (0 points deducted)
   - **Comments**: While the code is readable, it lacks comments explaining the purpose of each section and the custom force functor. (5 points deducted)
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: There are no unnecessary calculations or redundant code present. (0 points deducted)
   - **Optimization Opportunities**: The code could benefit from some optimizations, such as avoiding repeated calls to `chrono.ChVector3d` for static positions. (3 points deducted)
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Basic Error Handling**: There is no error handling implemented, which is a significant omission in simulation scripts. (5 points deducted)
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the addition of a skybox and proper lighting could enhance the visual quality. (3 points deducted)
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points
- Correctness: 0 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Total points deducted: 16 points (out of a possible 100 points)

Final score: 100 - 16 = 84

### Final Score Output
[[84]] 

### Explanation of Deductions
The script is well-structured and mostly correct, but it lacks comments for clarity, has minor optimization opportunities, and does not include any error handling, which is crucial for robustness in simulations. Additionally, while the visualization setup is functional, it could be improved for better visual quality.

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks a proper collision system setup (e.g., `SetCollisionSystemType`), which is present in the reference script. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - The reference script uses a particle emitter with specific configurations and properties that are not fully replicated in the provided code. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The custom gravitational force calculation in the provided code is not as efficient or accurate as the reference script's use of gravitational attraction based on mass and distance. The reference script uses a more appropriate gravitational constant and method for force calculation. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The particle emission logic does not account for the proper initialization of particle properties (e.g., mass, density) as seen in the reference script. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The code is relatively readable but lacks meaningful comments explaining the purpose of various sections and functions. The reference script provides better documentation and structure. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The gravitational force calculation iterates over all bodies for each particle, which is inefficient compared to the reference script's use of combinations to calculate forces only between pairs. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for potential issues (e.g., division by zero in gravitational calculations). The reference script handles such cases more robustly. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The visualization setup in the provided code is less comprehensive than in the reference script, which includes additional visual elements like a logo and skybox. **(Deduct 3 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 25 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 68 points
- Final Score: 100 - 68 = 32 points

**Final Score**: [[32]]

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks several essential components present in the reference script:
     - The reference script initializes a mesh and uses a specific beam section (Cosserat) which is not present in the provided code. (Deduct 15 points)
     - The reference script includes a detailed setup for the flywheel, including its attachment to the beam and the creation of a truss and bearing, which are missing in the provided code. (Deduct 15 points)
     - The provided code does not include a solver setup or a static linear analysis, which is present in the reference. (Deduct 10 points)
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 40 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: The provided code uses `chrono.ChSystemNSC()` while the reference uses `chrono.ChSystemSMC()`, which may lead to different simulation behaviors. (Deduct 15 points)
   - **Logical Errors**: The motor setup in the provided code is less detailed than in the reference, where a sine function is used for motor control. (Deduct 10 points)
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code is relatively straightforward but lacks comments explaining the purpose of various sections and choices made. (Deduct 5 points)
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The provided code does not optimize the visualization and rendering loop as effectively as the reference script, which includes more efficient rendering calls and setups. (Deduct 5 points)
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for common issues that might arise during simulation, which the reference script addresses. (Deduct 5 points)
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The provided code sets up visualization but lacks the detailed visual elements and lighting present in the reference script. (Deduct 3 points)
   - **Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 40 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 83 points
- Final Score: 100 - 83 = 17 points

### Final Score Output

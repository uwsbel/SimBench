### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code lacks the creation of fixed boxes in the scene, which are present in the reference script. The reference script creates 4 fixed boxes with specific properties, while the provided code generates 10 random boxes without fixed properties. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Minor Omissions (5 points each)**: 
     - The provided code does not include the texture setting for the boxes, which is present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: **20 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of PyChrono API (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code uses `chrono.ChBodyEasyBox` with parameters that do not match the reference script's usage, particularly in terms of material properties and fixed status. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors (10 points each)**: 
     - The provided code does not properly initialize the sensor manager with the vehicle system, which could lead to issues during simulation. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 to 10 points)**: 
     - The provided code is generally readable but lacks some organization compared to the reference script. The variable names are meaningful, but the structure could be improved. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Comments and Documentation (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code has fewer comments compared to the reference script, which affects the understanding of the code. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **10 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations or Redundant Code (5 points each)**: 
     - The provided code generates random boxes in a loop, which is less efficient than the fixed boxes in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are crucial for robustness. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Incorrect or Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 to 5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not set up the sensor manager and camera as effectively as the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: **5 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 20 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting with a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 70 points
- Final Score: 100 - 70 = 30

### Final Score Output

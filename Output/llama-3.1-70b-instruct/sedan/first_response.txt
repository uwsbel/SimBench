Based on the provided instructions, I will create a PyChrono simulation script. However, I need the actual instructions to proceed. Please provide the instructions, and I will create the script accordingly.

Once I have the instructions, I will ensure that the script:

1. Initializes the PyChrono environment and core components.
2. Adds the required physical systems and objects as specified.
3. Sets necessary default parameters such as positions, forces, and interactions.

Please provide the instructions, and I will create the script.

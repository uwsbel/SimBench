### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks several essential components present in the reference script:
     - **Collision System Type**: The reference script sets a collision system type (`chrono.ChCollisionSystem.Type_BULLET`), which is missing in the provided code. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - **Contact Material**: The reference script defines a contact material for the ground, which is not present in the provided code. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - **Texture for Ground**: The reference script applies a texture to the ground body, which is omitted in the provided code. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 35 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The provided code uses `chrono.ChBodyEasyBox` for the rover, while the reference script uses a specific Viper rover class (`viper.Viper`). This could lead to significant differences in simulation behavior. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors**: The provided code does not initialize the rover correctly with respect to its position and orientation, which is done in the reference script. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code is relatively readable, but it lacks meaningful comments and documentation compared to the reference script. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The provided code updates the simulation time manually (`system.GetChTime() += timestep`), which is unnecessary since the simulation loop already advances the time. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the simulation state, which could lead to issues during execution. The reference script has more robust handling. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The provided code does not set up the visualization as comprehensively as the reference script (e.g., missing skybox, logo, and typical lights). **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 35 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
- **Total Points Deducted**: 35 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 80 points
- **Final Score**: 100 - 80 = 20 points

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

#### Completeness (40 points total)
- **Missing Essential Components**: The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script. No deductions are necessary here.
- **Incorrect Configuration**: All configurations match the reference script, so no deductions apply.
- **Minor Omissions**: There are no minor omissions or deviations from the reference script. 

**Score: 0 points deducted**

#### Correctness (30 points total)
- **Incorrect Use of API**: The provided code correctly uses the PyChrono API, and there are no significant changes in simulation behavior compared to the reference script.
- **Logical Errors**: There are no logical errors present in the code.
- **Minor Inaccuracies**: There are no minor inaccuracies or unnecessary API calls that deviate from the reference script.

**Score: 0 points deducted**

#### Code Quality (10 points total)
- **Readability and Structure**: The code is well-structured and readable, similar to the reference script. No deductions apply.

- **Missing Optimization Opportunities**: There are no obvious optimization opportunities that are missed.

**Score: 0 points deducted**

#### Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)
- **Lack of Basic Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which could be important for robustness. A deduction of 5 points is warranted for this lack.

**Score: 5 points deducted**

#### Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)
- **Incorrect or Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is consistent with the reference script, and there are no issues with lighting or visual elements. No deductions apply.

**Score: 0 points deducted**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points deducted
- Correctness: 0 points deducted
- Code Quality: 5 points deducted
- Efficiency: 0 points deducted
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points deducted
- Use of Visualization Tools: 0 points deducted

### Final Score Calculation
The total deductions amount to 10 points. The maximum score is 100 points, so the final score is:

**Final Score: 100 - 10 = 90**

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, mesh creation, beam section definition, node and element addition, force and torque application, and visualization setup. 
   - However, there is a minor omission in the comments regarding the second beam creation, where it should clarify that it uses the last node created by the previous beam. This results in a **5-point deduction**.
   - **Total Deductions: 5 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly uses the PyChrono API for the most part. However, there is a logical error in the second beam creation where it does not explicitly use the last created node as the starting point for the new beam. This could lead to confusion and potentially incorrect simulation behavior. This results in a **10-point deduction**.
   - **Total Deductions: 10 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable. However, there are some comments that could be more descriptive, particularly around the beam creation sections. This results in a **5-point deduction** for insufficient comments.
   - **Total Deductions: 5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code is efficient and does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows the reference script closely in terms of API usage. No deductions are warranted in this category.
   - **Total Deductions: 0 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks explicit error handling, which is not addressed in the reference script either. However, it does not account for potential issues that could arise during the simulation. This results in a **5-point deduction**.
   - **Total Deductions: 5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct and matches the reference script. However, there is a minor issue with the lighting setup that could be improved. This results in a **2-point deduction**.
   - **Total Deductions: 2 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 10 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 5 + 10 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 2 = 27 points
- Final Score: 100 - 27 = 73

### Final Score Output
[[73]]

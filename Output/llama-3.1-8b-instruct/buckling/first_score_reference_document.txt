### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks several essential components that are present in the reference script:
     - **System Initialization**: The reference uses `chrono.ChSystemSMC()`, while the provided code uses `chrono.ChSystem()`, which is not a valid initialization according to the API documentation. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - **Body Creation**: The reference script creates multiple bodies with specific properties and visual shapes, while the provided code only creates a beam without any detailed properties or visual shapes. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - **Visualization Setup**: The reference script includes a comprehensive visualization setup, including camera, lights, and logo, which is missing in the provided code. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - Total deductions for completeness: **45 points** (exceeds the maximum, capped at 40 points).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code uses `chrono.ChBeam2D`, which is not a standard class in the PyChrono library. The reference uses `fea.ChBeamSectionCosserat` and other specific classes for beam creation. This incorrect use could lead to significant changes in simulation behavior. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - There are no logical errors in the provided code, but the incorrect class usage is critical. **(Deduct 10 points for incorrect API usage)**
   - Total deductions for correctness: **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks meaningful comments and documentation, making it difficult to understand the purpose of various sections. The reference script is well-commented and structured. **(Deduct 10 points)**.
   - Total deductions for code quality: **10 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not demonstrate any unnecessary calculations or redundant code, but it also does not implement any optimizations found in the reference script. **(Deduct 3 points for missing optimization opportunities)**.
   - Total deductions for efficiency: **3 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are present in the reference script. **(Deduct 5 points)**.
   - Total deductions for error handling: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not set up any visualization tools, while the reference script includes a comprehensive visualization setup. **(Deduct 5 points)**.
   - Total deductions for visualization tools: **5 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: **40 points**
- Correctness: **25 points**
- Code Quality: **10 points**
- Efficiency: **3 points**
- Error Handling: **5 points**
- Visualization Tools: **5 points**

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a maximum score of 100 points:
- Total deductions: **40 + 25 + 10 + 3 + 5 + 5 = 88 points**
- Final score: **100 - 88 = 12 points**

### Final Score

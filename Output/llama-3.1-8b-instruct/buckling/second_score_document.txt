### Final Score Calculation
- **Completeness**: 0 points
- **Correctness**: 0 points
- **Code Quality**: 0 points
- **Efficiency**: 0 points
- **Error Handling and Robustness**: -5 points
- **Use of Visualization Tools**: 0 points

**Total Score**: 50 points (out of 100)

### Final Score Output
[[50]] 

### Explanation of Deductions
The only deduction was for the lack of basic error handling, which is important for ensuring robustness in simulations. The script is otherwise complete, correct, well-structured, efficient, and effectively utilizes visualization tools.

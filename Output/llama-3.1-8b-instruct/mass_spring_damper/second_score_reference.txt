### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. However, there are some minor deviations:
     - The `MySpringForce` class in the provided code does not match the reference implementation in terms of method signatures and usage. The reference uses `evaluate` instead of `GetForce`, which is a significant difference in how the force is calculated.
     - The color of `box_2` in the provided code is set to `(0.6, 0, 0)` while the reference uses `(0, 0, 0.6)`, which is a minor deviation.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for minor deviations.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code uses `GetForce` in the `MySpringForce` class, which is not the same as the `evaluate` method used in the reference. This could lead to a significant change in simulation behavior.
   - The initialization of the spring with the custom force functor is done correctly, but the method name mismatch is a critical error.
   - **Deductions**: 15 points for incorrect use of the PyChrono API.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks some comments that would help clarify the purpose of certain sections, especially around the custom force functor.
   - The variable names are meaningful, but the lack of comments on the custom force functor reduces the overall quality.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit any unnecessary calculations or redundant code. However, the use of `GetForce` instead of the more appropriate `evaluate` method could be seen as a missed optimization opportunity.
   - **Deductions**: 3 points for missing an obvious optimization opportunity.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms. The reference script does not explicitly show error handling, but it is generally a good practice to include checks for potential issues.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of basic error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the color of `box_2` is inconsistent with the reference script. This could affect the visual representation of the simulation.
   - **Deductions**: 3 points for incorrect visualization setup.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 5 + 15 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 3 = 36
- Final Score: 100 - 36 = 64

**Final Score**: [[64]]

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code is missing the creation of `body_2` and `body_3` at the correct positions as per the reference script. The positions of `body_2` and `body_3` in the provided code are incorrect (both are at `-3` in the y-direction), while in the reference script, `body_2` is at `-6` and `body_3` is at `-9`. This results in a deduction of **15 points** for each body, totaling **30 points**.
   - The visualization assets for `body_2` and `body_3` have different colors compared to the reference script, which is a minor deviation. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - Total completeness deduction: **35 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The initialization of springs between bodies is incorrect in the provided code. The reference script initializes `spring_2` between `body_1` and `body_2` and `spring_3` between `body_2` and `body_3`, while the provided code initializes them incorrectly. This results in a deduction of **15 points** for each incorrect initialization, totaling **30 points**.
   - Total correctness deduction: **30 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The provided code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks some comments that would enhance understanding. However, it does provide basic comments for sections. The reference script has slightly better documentation. Thus, a deduction of **5 points** is appropriate.
   - Total code quality deduction: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not exhibit significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. There are no unnecessary calculations or redundant code present. Therefore, no deductions are necessary in this category.
   - Total efficiency deduction: **0 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling or robustness checks, which are not explicitly mentioned in the reference script but are generally good practice. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - Total error handling deduction: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup in the provided code is mostly correct, but the title of the window differs from the reference script. This results in a deduction of **2 points** for the minor visualization issue.
   - Total visualization deduction: **2 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: **35 points**
- Correctness: **30 points**
- Code Quality: **5 points**
- Efficiency: **0 points**
- Error Handling: **5 points**
- Visualization: **2 points**

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- 100 - (35 + 30 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 2) = 100 - 77 = 23

### Final Score

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks essential components present in the reference script:
     - **System Initialization**: The reference script initializes a physical system (`sys = chrono.ChSystemNSC()`) and sets the collision system type. The provided code does not have this initialization. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - **Body Creation**: The reference script creates a sphere body with specific properties and adds it to the system. The provided code does not create any bodies. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - **Visualization Setup**: The reference script sets up visualization using Irrlicht, while the provided code does not include any visualization setup. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - Total deductions for completeness: **45 points** (capped at 40 points).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code does not utilize the PyChrono API correctly:
     - **Incorrect Imports**: The provided code imports many classes and functions redundantly and incorrectly (e.g., importing `ChSphere`, `ChBox`, etc., multiple times). This could lead to confusion and inefficiencies. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - **Missing Functionality**: The provided code does not implement any particle emitter functionality or gravitational attraction logic, which are critical for the simulation. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - Total deductions for correctness: **30 points** (capped at 30 points).

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks readability and structure:
     - **Poor Readability**: The excessive repetition of imports and lack of organization make the code difficult to read. **(Deduct 10 points)**
     - **Lack of Comments**: There are no comments or documentation to explain the code, which is a significant deviation from the reference script. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - Total deductions for code quality: **15 points** (capped at 10 points).

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code is inefficient due to redundant imports:
     - **Redundant Imports**: The same classes are imported multiple times, which is unnecessary and inefficient. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - Total deductions for efficiency: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling or robustness checks:
     - **Lack of Error Handling**: There are no checks for potential issues that could arise during execution. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - Total deductions for error handling and robustness: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not utilize any visualization tools:
     - **No Visualization Setup**: The absence of any visualization setup leads to a deduction. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - Total deductions for visualization tools: **5 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points
- Correctness: 30 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Deductions: 40 + 30 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 95 points
- Final Score: 100 - 95 = 5 points

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Essential Components**: The script includes system initialization, body creation, visualization setup, and a simulation loop. All essential components are present.
   - **Details**: The pendulum's mass and inertia are set, and the visualization elements are adequately configured. No essential components are missing.
   - **Score**: 40/40

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The initialization of the spherical joint (`ChLinkLockSpherical`) is done correctly, but the frame used in `sph_1.Initialize` should ideally be the position of the pendulum's center of mass, which is not explicitly stated. However, this is a minor issue.
   - **Logical Errors**: The pendulum's initial position and angular velocity are set correctly, and the simulation step is appropriately defined.
   - **Score**: 25/30 (5 points deducted for the minor issue with joint initialization)

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. However, some comments could be more descriptive, especially regarding the purpose of certain parameters.
   - **Comments**: While there are comments present, they could be expanded for clarity.
   - **Score**: 8/10 (2 points deducted for insufficient comments)

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The script does not contain any unnecessary calculations or redundant code. The simulation step is appropriately set.
   - **Optimization Opportunities**: There are no apparent optimization opportunities missed.
   - **Score**: 10/10

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Basic Error Handling**: The script lacks any error handling mechanisms, such as checks for successful initialization or valid parameters.
   - **Edge Cases**: There is no consideration for edge cases, such as what happens if the visualization fails to initialize.
   - **Score**: 0/5 (5 points deducted for lack of error handling)

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is comprehensive, including a skybox, camera, and lighting. However, the joint visualization could be enhanced by ensuring that the visual shape is correctly associated with the joint.
   - **Minor Issues**: The joint visualization is present but could be more effectively integrated.
   - **Score**: 3/5 (2 points deducted for minor visualization issues)

### Final Score Calculation
- Completeness: 40/40
- Correctness: 25/30
- Code Quality: 8/10
- Efficiency: 10/10
- Error Handling and Robustness: 0/5
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3/5

**Total Score**: 40 + 25 + 8 + 10 + 0 + 3 = 86

### Final Score Output
[[86]]

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code is largely complete, but there are some discrepancies:
     - **Missing Initial Position for the Second Pendulum**: The second pendulum's initial position is set to `(1, 0, 0)` instead of `(3, 0, 1)` as in the reference. This is a significant deviation. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - **Joint Initialization for the Second Pendulum**: The initialization frame for the second revolute joint is incorrect; it should be `(2, 0, 1)` instead of `(0, 0, 1)`. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - Total deductions: **25 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of Time Step in Simulation Loop**: The time step for `sys.DoStepDynamics` is set to `1e-3`, while the reference uses `1e-2`. This could lead to a significant difference in simulation behavior. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors in Joint Initialization**: The initialization of the second joint is not aligned with the reference, which could affect the simulation's accuracy. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - Total deductions: **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but there are some minor issues:
     - **Variable Naming**: The variable names are somewhat generic (e.g., `cyl_1`, `cyl_2`), which could be improved for clarity. **(Deduct 5 points)**
     - **Comments**: While there are comments, they could be more descriptive in some areas, particularly around the joint initialization. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - Total deductions: **10 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit significant inefficiencies compared to the reference. However, the time step discrepancy could lead to less efficient simulation performance. **(Deduct 5 points)**.
   - Total deductions: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - There is no explicit error handling in the provided code, which could lead to issues if the simulation encounters unexpected conditions. The reference code does not show any error handling either, but it is a best practice to include it. **(Deduct 5 points)**.
   - Total deductions: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the window title in the provided code is slightly different from the reference. The reference uses "Double Pendulum Simulation" instead of "Double Pendulum demo". **(Deduct 2 points)**.
   - Total deductions: **2 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
The original score is 100 points. After applying the deductions:
- Total deductions: 72 points
- Final Score: 100 - 72 = 28 points

### Final Score Output

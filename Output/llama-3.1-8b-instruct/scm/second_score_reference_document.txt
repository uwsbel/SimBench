### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: The provided code lacks the explicit initialization of terrain parameters using the `SCMParameters` class as seen in the reference script. Instead, it uses a custom `TerrainParameters` class which is not standard and may lead to confusion. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Incorrect Configuration**: The terrain parameters are set using a custom method rather than the standard method seen in the reference. This is a significant deviation from best practices. Deduct **10 points**.
   - **Minor Omissions**: The provided code does not set the plot type for the SCM terrain, which is present in the reference. Deduct **5 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Completeness: 30 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The provided code uses a custom terrain parameter class instead of the `SCMParameters` class, which could lead to incorrect simulation behavior. Deduct **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: The terrain parameters are not initialized correctly, which could affect the simulation's accuracy. Deduct **10 points**.
   - **Minor Inaccuracies**: The terrain initialization does not include setting the plot type, which is a minor deviation. Deduct **5 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Correctness: 30 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured, but the use of a custom terrain parameter class without clear documentation reduces readability. Deduct **5 points**.
   - **Comments and Documentation**: There are insufficient comments explaining the purpose of the custom `TerrainParameters` class and its methods. Deduct **5 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Code Quality: 10 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The custom terrain parameter class introduces unnecessary complexity and could lead to inefficient calculations. Deduct **5 points**.
   - **Missing Optimization Opportunities**: The code does not utilize the built-in `SCMParameters` class, which is optimized for setting terrain parameters. Deduct **3 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Efficiency: 8 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling for potential issues during initialization or simulation steps. Deduct **5 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Error Handling: 5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the absence of setting the plot type for the SCM terrain is a significant omission. Deduct **3 points**.
   - **Minor Visualization Issues**: The lighting and camera setup are adequate, but could be improved. Deduct **2 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools: 5 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 30 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 8 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
The total deductions amount to **88 points**. Assuming a perfect score of **100 points**, the final score is:

\[ 100 - 88 = 12 \]

### Final Score Output

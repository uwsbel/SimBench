### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: The provided code is mostly complete but has a significant difference in the handling of gravity. The reference script sets gravity to `True`, while the provided script disables it. This could lead to a different simulation behavior. **Deduct 10 points**.
   - **Minor Omissions**: The provided script includes comments that are not formatted correctly (e.g., using triple quotes instead of `#` for comments). **Deduct 5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The provided script uses `mesh.SetAutomaticGravity(False)`, which is not the same as the reference script that sets it to `True`. This is a significant change in simulation behavior. **Deduct 15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: There are no other significant logical errors in the code. 
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code is generally well-structured, but the use of triple quotes for comments is not standard practice and can reduce readability. **Deduct 5 points**.
   - **Insufficient Comments**: The comments are somewhat verbose and could be more concise. However, they do provide a good level of detail. **Deduct 3 points** for minor issues.
   - **Total Deductions**: 8 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The provided code does not show any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. Both scripts are similar in terms of efficiency.
   - **Total Deductions**: 0 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Basic Error Handling**: The provided script has basic error handling for directory creation, which is good. There are no significant issues in this area.
   - **Total Deductions**: 0 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The provided script sets up visualization similarly to the reference script, but there are minor differences in the configuration of visual shapes (e.g., the order of setting properties). **Deduct 2 points** for minor visualization issues.
   - **Total Deductions**: 2 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 15 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 8 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling: 0 points
- Visualization: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
- **Total Points Deducted**: 15 + 15 + 8 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 40 points
- **Total Possible Points**: 100
- **Final Score**: 100 - 40 = 60

### Final Score Output
[[60]]

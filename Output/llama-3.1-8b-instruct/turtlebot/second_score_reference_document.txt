### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, ground body creation, robot creation, and visualization setup. However, the `move` function defines `WheelID` inside the function instead of as a class-level constant, which is less organized. 
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for minor deviations in organization and structure.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The robot's motor speed settings in the `move` function are incorrect compared to the reference. The reference uses negative values for the motor speeds, which is crucial for correct movement direction. The provided code uses zero for straight movement, which may not be appropriate.
   - **Deductions**: 15 points for incorrect use of motor speed settings.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally readable and well-structured, but the comments could be more descriptive. For example, the comment "Function to control the robot's movement" could specify the parameters and expected behavior more clearly.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not have any significant inefficiencies, but the `move` function could be optimized by avoiding repeated calls to `robot.SetMotorSpeed` for the same wheel. Instead, it could set both speeds in one call.
   - **Deductions**: 3 points for missing optimization opportunities.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The error handling in the `move` function is adequate, raising a `ValueError` for invalid modes. However, there is no handling for potential issues with the robot's initialization or visualization setup.
   - **Deductions**: 3 points for inadequate handling of edge cases.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the comment about enabling shadows could be misleading as it implies that shadows were previously disabled. It would be clearer to state that shadows are now enabled.
   - **Deductions**: 2 points for minor visualization issues.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 3 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total deductions: 33 points
- Final score: 100 - 33 = 67

### Final Score

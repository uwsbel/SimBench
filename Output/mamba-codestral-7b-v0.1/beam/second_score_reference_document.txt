### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided script lacks the use of the `ChBuilderBeamEuler` helper object, which is a significant omission as it simplifies the creation of beam elements. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Visualization Initialization**: The visualization window is not fully initialized (missing `vis.Initialize()`), which is another essential component. This results in an additional deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The script does not change the solver to MKL Pardiso, which is a significant aspect of the reference script. This leads to a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: The constraints for fixing nodes are set correctly, but the lack of a proper solver setup is a logical error that affects simulation behavior. This results in an additional deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it could benefit from more comments explaining the purpose of certain sections. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The script does not utilize the `ChBuilderBeamEuler`, which would optimize the creation of beam elements. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The script does not include any error handling mechanisms or checks for common issues, which is a significant oversight. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is incomplete, lacking the initialization and additional visual elements present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 75 points
- Final Score: 100 - 75 = 25

### Final Score
[[25]]

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. However, the comment regarding Rayleigh damping states "to zero" instead of "to 0.0001," which is misleading. This results in a deduction of **5 points** for minor inaccuracies.
   - Total Deductions: **5 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly implements the creation of the beam and applies forces and constraints as intended. However, the comment about Rayleigh damping is misleading, which could lead to confusion about its actual value. This results in a deduction of **5 points** for minor inaccuracies.
   - Total Deductions: **5 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, with appropriate comments. However, there are some minor formatting issues, such as inconsistent spacing in the comments and code blocks. This results in a deduction of **5 points** for readability.
   - Total Deductions: **5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit any unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows a logical structure similar to the reference script. No deductions are warranted in this category.
   - Total Deductions: **0 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The code lacks explicit error handling for potential issues that could arise during the simulation, such as checking if the mesh or system is properly initialized before proceeding. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - Total Deductions: **5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is adequate and closely follows the reference script. However, there is a minor issue with the lighting setup, which could be improved. This results in a deduction of **2 points** for minor visualization issues.
   - Total Deductions: **2 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 5 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 5 + 5 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 2 = 22 points
- Final Score: 100 - 22 = 78

### Final Score Output
[[78]]

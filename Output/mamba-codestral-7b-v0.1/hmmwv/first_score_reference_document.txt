### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks several essential components that are present in the reference script, such as:
       - Initialization of the visualization system (`ChWheeledVehicleVisualSystemIrrlicht`).
       - Driver system initialization (`ChInteractiveDriverIRR`).
       - Proper terrain creation and initialization.
       - Vehicle mass output and simulation loop structure.
     - **Deductions**: 15 points for each missing essential component (total of 4 missing components) = **60 points** (exceeds maximum, capped at 40 points).
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: **40 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: 
     - The code uses `pychrono.ChSystemSMC()` instead of `pychrono.ChSystemNSC()`, which is more commonly used for vehicle simulations.
     - The tire parameters are set incorrectly; the reference uses a specific tire model and parameters.
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The vehicle initialization is incomplete, lacking proper setup for visualization and driver inputs.
   - **Deductions**: 15 points for incorrect API usage and 10 points for logical errors = **25 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The code lacks meaningful variable names and comments, making it less readable compared to the reference script.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for poor readability and 5 points for insufficient comments = **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **10 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The provided code has redundant calls and lacks optimizations present in the reference script.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for unnecessary calculations and 3 points for missing optimization opportunities = **8 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **8 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms or checks for common issues.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of basic error handling.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code does not set up a visualization system, which is crucial for vehicle simulations.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for inadequate visualization setup.
   - **Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools**: **5 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: **40 points**
- Correctness: **25 points**
- Code Quality: **10 points**
- Efficiency: **8 points**
- Error Handling and Robustness: **5 points**
- Use of Visualization Tools: **5 points**

### Final Score Calculation
- Starting Score: 100 points
- Total Deductions: 40 + 25 + 10 + 8 + 5 + 5 = **93 points**
- Final Score: 100 - 93 = **7 points**

### Final Score Output

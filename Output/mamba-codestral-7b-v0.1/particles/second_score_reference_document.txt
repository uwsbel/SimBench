### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script, such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. Therefore, no points are deducted here.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The gravitational constant `G_constant` is defined inside the simulation loop in the provided code, while in the reference script, it is defined before the energy calculations. This could lead to confusion and potential errors if the variable is used before being defined.
   - The calculation of potential energy in the provided code is done after the force accumulation, which is not the same order as in the reference script. This could lead to logical errors in energy calculations.
   - **Score: 10 points deducted for logical errors.**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of certain blocks, especially in the simulation loop. The reference script provides better documentation.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted for insufficient comments.**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code calculates the total energy before accumulating forces, which is less efficient than the reference script's approach. The reference script calculates kinetic and potential energy after force accumulation, which is more logical and efficient.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted for unnecessary calculations.**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, such as checking for empty bodies or ensuring that the simulation runs without issues. The reference script does not explicitly handle errors either, but it is generally more robust in structure.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted for lack of basic error handling.**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup in the provided code is adequate and matches the reference script. However, there are minor differences in the lighting setup and camera positioning that could enhance the visualization.
   - **Score: 2 points deducted for minor visualization issues.**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points
- Correctness: 10 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a total of 100 points:
- Total deductions: 10 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 2 = 27 points
- Final score: 100 - 27 = 73

**Final Score: [[73]]**

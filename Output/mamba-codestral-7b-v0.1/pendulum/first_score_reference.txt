### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code lacks the setting of gravitational acceleration, which is present in the reference script. **(15 points deduction)**
     - The reference script includes a visual representation of the ground (a cylinder), which is absent in the provided code. **(15 points deduction)**
   - **Incorrect Configuration (10 points)**: 
     - The pendulum's inertia is set incorrectly. The reference script uses `SetInertiaXX` for setting the inertia tensor, while the provided code uses `SetInertia`, which is not appropriate for defining the inertia tensor. **(10 points deduction)**
   - **Minor Omissions (5 points)**: 
     - The reference script includes a camera setup and lighting, which enhances visualization but are not present in the provided code. **(5 points deduction)**

   **Total Deductions for Completeness: 45 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage (15 points each)**: 
     - The use of `ChSystemSMC` instead of `ChSystemNSC` may lead to different simulation behavior, as the two systems have different properties. **(15 points deduction)**
   - **Logical Errors (10 points)**: 
     - The revolute joint initialization is not done correctly. The reference script uses `ChLinkLockRevolute`, while the provided code uses `ChLinkRevolute`, which may not be appropriate for the intended behavior. **(10 points deduction)**
   - **Minor Inaccuracies (5 points)**: 
     - The pendulum's position is set at `(0, 5, 0)`, which is not consistent with the reference script's initial position of `(1, 0, 1)`. **(5 points deduction)**

   **Total Deductions for Correctness: 30 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 to 10 points)**: 
     - The provided code lacks meaningful variable names and structure compared to the reference script. For example, `ground_body` and `pendulum` could be more descriptive. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Insufficient Comments (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code has fewer comments explaining the purpose of each section compared to the reference script. **(5 points deduction)**

   **Total Deductions for Code Quality: 10 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not optimize the visualization setup as effectively as the reference script, which includes additional visual elements and optimizations. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Missing Optimization Opportunities (3 points)**: 
     - The simulation step size is hardcoded, whereas the reference script uses a more flexible approach. **(3 points deduction)**

   **Total Deductions for Efficiency: 8 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the simulation state, which is present in the reference script. **(5 points deduction)**

   **Total Deductions for Error Handling: 5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 to 5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not include a skybox, camera setup, or lighting, which are present in the reference script. **(5 points deduction)**

   **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools: 5 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 45 points
- Correctness: 30 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 8 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 45 + 30 + 10 + 8 + 5 + 5 = 103 points

Since the total deductions exceed the maximum score, the final score is capped at 0.

### Final Score

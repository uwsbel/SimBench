### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: The script includes all essential components for a basic double pendulum simulation, such as system initialization, body creation, joint setup, and visualization. No deductions here.
   - **Configuration Details**: The pendulum bodies are correctly configured with mass and inertia. The ground body is also appropriately set up. No deductions here.
   - **Minor Omissions**: The script could benefit from defining contact materials for the pendulum and ground bodies, which is a common practice in simulations involving collisions. **(5 points deduction)**

   **Total Deductions for Completeness: 5 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The revolute joints are initialized correctly, and the bodies are set up appropriately. No significant errors in API usage were found. No deductions here.
   - **Logical Errors**: The initialization of the pendulum positions and the revolute joints appears logical and consistent with the intended simulation. No deductions here.
   - **Minor Inaccuracies**: The use of `chrono.ChFramed` for joint initialization is correct, but the frame for the revolute joint could be more explicitly defined to ensure clarity. **(5 points deduction)**

   **Total Deductions for Correctness: 5 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. No deductions here.
   - **Comments**: While there are some comments explaining the code, they could be more detailed, especially regarding the purpose of certain configurations and the simulation loop. **(5 points deduction)**

   **Total Deductions for Code Quality: 5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The code does not contain any unnecessary calculations or redundant code. No deductions here.
   - **Optimization Opportunities**: The simulation loop could be optimized by adjusting the time step dynamically based on the simulation state, but this is not a critical issue. **(3 points deduction)**

   **Total Deductions for Efficiency: 3 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling**: The script does not include any error handling mechanisms, such as checking if the bodies are successfully added to the system or if the visualization initializes correctly. **(5 points deduction)**

   **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, with a window size, title, and camera position defined. However, the lighting could be improved for better visibility. **(3 points deduction)**

   **Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points**

### Final Score Calculation
- **Total Points Deducted**: 5 (Completeness) + 5 (Correctness) + 5 (Code Quality) + 3 (Efficiency) + 5 (Error Handling) + 3 (Visualization) = 26 points
- **Final Score**: 100 - 26 = 74

### Final Score Output
[[74]]

### Explanation of Deductions
- **5 points** for minor omissions in defining contact materials.
- **5 points** for minor inaccuracies in joint initialization clarity.
- **5 points** for insufficient comments in the code.
- **3 points** for missing optimization opportunities in the simulation loop.
- **5 points** for lack of basic error handling.
- **3 points** for inadequate lighting in the visualization setup.

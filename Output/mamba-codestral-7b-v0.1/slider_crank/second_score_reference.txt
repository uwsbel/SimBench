### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, visualization, and simulation loop. However, it lacks the comment headers that explain the purpose of each section, which are present in the reference script. 
   - **Deductions: 5 points** for minor omissions in comments.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly initializes the bodies and joints, but there is a significant issue with how the motor angle is recorded. The reference script uses `my_motor.GetMotorAngle()`, while the provided code uses `mcrank.GetPos().x()`, which does not accurately reflect the motor's angle. This could lead to incorrect plotting of the crank angle.
   - **Deductions: 15 points** for incorrect use of the PyChrono API that could significantly change simulation behavior.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of various sections and operations. The reference script provides better documentation.
   - **Deductions: 5 points** for insufficient comments.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not exhibit any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, it could be argued that the way it appends values to the arrays could be optimized, but this is a minor point.
   - **Deductions: 3 points** for missing obvious optimization opportunities.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for potential issues during the simulation. The reference script does not explicitly handle errors either, but it does have a more robust way of closing the visualization device.
   - **Deductions: 5 points** for lack of basic error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the provided code does not include the line to close the visualization device properly, which is present in the reference script.
   - **Deductions: 3 points** for inadequate visualization setup.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 36 points
- Final Score: 100 - 36 = 64

**Final Score: [[64]]**

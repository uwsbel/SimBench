### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. However, it lacks some comments that explain the purpose of certain sections, which are present in the reference script.
   - **Deductions: 5 points** for minor omissions in comments.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly uses the PyChrono API for the most part. However, there is a minor issue with the initialization of the planar joint. The reference script uses `plane_plane` for clarity, while the provided code uses `mjointC`, which could lead to confusion.
   - **Deductions: 5 points** for minor inaccuracies in naming conventions.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks some comments that would enhance understanding. The variable names are appropriate, but the absence of detailed comments reduces clarity.
   - **Deductions: 5 points** for insufficient comments.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code is efficient and does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows the structure of the reference script well.
   - **Deductions: 0 points** for efficiency.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which could be important for robustness. The reference script does not explicitly mention error handling, but it is generally a good practice to include it.
   - **Deductions: 5 points** for lack of error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the provided code does not include comments explaining the purpose of each visualization step, which is present in the reference script.
   - **Deductions: 2 points** for minor visualization issues due to lack of comments.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 5 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a full score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 5 + 5 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 2 = 22 points
- Final Score: 100 - 22 = 78

Thus, the final score is [[78]].

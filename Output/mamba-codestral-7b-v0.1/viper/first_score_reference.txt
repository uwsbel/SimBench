### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code lacks the initialization of the collision system and gravitational acceleration, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
     - The ground body is not fixed in place, which is a crucial detail in the reference script. This results in another deduction of **15 points**.
     - The Viper rover is not initialized properly with a driver, which is a significant omission. This results in another deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 15 + 15 + 15 = **45 points** (exceeds the maximum, capped at 40 points).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API (15 points each)**: 
     - The use of `ChSystemSMC()` instead of `ChSystemNSC()` is a significant deviation that could affect simulation behavior. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors (10 points)**: 
     - The rover's position is set multiple times unnecessarily, which is not efficient and could lead to confusion. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 15 + 10 = **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code lacks meaningful comments and structure compared to the reference script, which is well-documented. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations (5 points)**: 
     - The repeated setting of the rover's position is inefficient. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or robustness checks, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not set up the visualization properly, lacking camera settings and lighting, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points (capped)
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Deductions: 40 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 83 points
- Final Score: 100 - 83 = **17 points**

### Final Score Output

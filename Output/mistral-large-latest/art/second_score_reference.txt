### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script. There are no missing components, and all necessary initializations and configurations are present.
   - **Score Deduction**: **0 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly uses the PyChrono API, and there are no significant errors that would lead to a change in simulation behavior. All parameters and methods are used correctly as per the reference script.
   - **Score Deduction**: **0 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. However, there are some minor formatting inconsistencies, such as spacing around operators and comments that could be improved for better clarity.
   - **Score Deduction**: **5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It efficiently uses the APIs as intended. There are no obvious optimization opportunities missed compared to the reference script.
   - **Score Deduction**: **0 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks explicit error handling mechanisms. While it may not be strictly necessary for this simulation context, the reference script does not include any error handling either, but it is generally a good practice to include basic checks.
   - **Score Deduction**: **5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup in the provided code is adequate and matches the reference script. There are no significant issues with the visualization tools used.
   - **Score Deduction**: **0 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- **Completeness**: 0 points
- **Correctness**: 0 points
- **Code Quality**: -5 points
- **Efficiency**: 0 points
- **Error Handling and Robustness**: -5 points
- **Use of Visualization Tools**: 0 points

### Final Score Calculation
The total deductions amount to 10 points. The maximum score is 100 points, so the final score is:

\[100 - 10 = 90\]

### Final Score
[[90]]

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks the use of a proper material definition for the beam elements, which is present in the reference script. The reference script uses a `ChBeamSectionEulerAdvanced` and sets various properties for the beam section, which is crucial for accurate simulation. 
     - The reference script also initializes a solver (`ChSolverPardisoMKL`) for better performance, which is missing in the provided code.
     - The provided code does not include constraints or forces applied to the nodes, which are essential for simulating realistic behavior.
     - **Deductions**: 15 points for missing material properties, 15 points for missing solver initialization, and 15 points for missing constraints and forces. Total: **45 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The provided code uses `ChSystemNSC`, while the reference uses `ChSystemSMC`, which may lead to different simulation behaviors regarding contact handling.
     - The provided code does not apply forces or torques to the nodes, which is a significant omission that affects the simulation's dynamics.
     - **Deductions**: 15 points for incorrect system initialization and 15 points for missing forces/torques. Total: **30 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Comments**: 
     - The provided code lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of each section, which makes it less readable compared to the reference script.
     - Variable names are generally clear, but the overall structure could be improved with better organization and comments.
     - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments and 5 points for poor readability. Total: **10 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Redundant Code**: 
     - The provided code does not exhibit significant redundancy, but it lacks optimizations present in the reference script, such as the use of advanced beam sections and solver settings.
     - **Deductions**: 5 points for missing optimizations. Total: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for successful initialization of components, which could lead to runtime issues.
     - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of error handling. Total: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code does set up visualization, but it does not include advanced visualization features like visual shapes for the beam elements or proper lighting, which are present in the reference script.
     - **Deductions**: 3 points for inadequate visualization setup. Total: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 45 points
- Correctness: 30 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a full score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 45 + 30 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 98 points
- Final Score: 100 - 98 = 2 points

Thus, the final score for the provided PyChrono code is:

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code lacks a detailed setup for the beam mesh compared to the reference script, which includes specific properties for the beam sections and constraints. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
     - The reference script uses a more complex setup for the motor and constraints, which is not fully replicated in the provided code. This also results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code uses `chrono.ChForce()` for applying a force, which is less appropriate than the methods used in the reference script for applying forces and constraints. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors (10 points)**: 
     - The initialization of the motor and constraints in the provided code is not as robust as in the reference script, leading to a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 to 10 points)**: 
     - The provided code lacks meaningful comments and has less clear variable naming compared to the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code could be optimized further in terms of how forces and constraints are applied. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 to 5 points)**: 
     - The visualization setup in the provided code is less comprehensive than in the reference script, which includes additional visual elements and better camera positioning. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
- Starting Score: 100
- Total Deductions: 73 points
- Final Score: 100 - 73 = 27

### Final Score Output

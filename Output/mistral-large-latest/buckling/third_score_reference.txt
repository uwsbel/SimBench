### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes most essential components, such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. However, there are some discrepancies:
     - The output directory name is different from the reference script, which may indicate a lack of attention to detail. (Deduct 5 points)
     - The number of elements in the IGA beam and the Euler beam is different from the reference, which could affect the simulation results. (Deduct 10 points)
     - The visualization shapes for the truss and crank have different dimensions compared to the reference. (Deduct 5 points)
   - **Total Deductions: 20 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The use of `ChLinkMotorRotationSpeed` instead of `ChLinkMotorRotationAngle` is a significant deviation that could alter the simulation behavior. (Deduct 15 points)
   - The `Get_y` method in the custom function class should be `GetVal` to match the reference. (Deduct 10 points)
   - The setting of the Young's modulus and shear modulus in the beam sections is inconsistent with the reference values. (Deduct 5 points)
   - **Total Deductions: 30 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but there are some variable names that could be more descriptive. (Deduct 5 points)
   - The comments are present but could be more detailed in some areas, especially regarding the purpose of certain parameters. (Deduct 5 points)
   - **Total Deductions: 10 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not appear to have significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script, but there are some redundant calculations that could be optimized. (Deduct 5 points)
   - **Total Deductions: 5 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks any error handling mechanisms, which could lead to issues during execution. (Deduct 5 points)
   - **Total Deductions: 5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the dimensions and types of visual shapes differ from the reference, which could impact the clarity of the simulation. (Deduct 3 points)
   - **Total Deductions: 3 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 20 points
- Correctness: 30 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 20 + 30 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 73 points
- Final Score: 100 - 73 = 27

### Final Score Output

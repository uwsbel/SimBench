### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. However, there is a minor deviation in the obstacle creation. The reference script uses a different size and texture for the obstacle, which could be considered a slight omission. 
   - **Deduction**: 5 points for the minor deviation in obstacle creation.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The use of the PyChrono API is mostly correct. However, the obstacle's dimensions and texture differ from the reference script, which could affect the simulation's intended behavior. The reference script uses a different size and texture for the obstacle, which could lead to a significant change in simulation behavior.
   - **Deduction**: 15 points for the incorrect use of the obstacle dimensions and texture.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. However, there are some comments that could be more descriptive, especially regarding the purpose of certain sections of the code.
   - **Deduction**: 5 points for insufficient comments.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code is efficient and does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows the best practices outlined in the PyChrono API documentation.
   - **Deduction**: 0 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which could be a concern in a real-world scenario. The reference script does not explicitly handle errors either, but it is generally good practice to include some basic error handling.
   - **Deduction**: 5 points for lack of error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the texture for the obstacle is different from the reference script, which could affect the visual representation of the simulation.
   - **Deduction**: 3 points for the incorrect texture setup.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- 100 - (5 + 15 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 3) = 100 - 33 = 67

### Final Score

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes the creation of the physical system, bodies, springs, and visualization, similar to the reference script. However, there are some notable differences:
     - **Missing Bodies**: The reference script has three bodies, while the provided code has three bodies but with different positions for body_2 and body_3. The positions of body_2 and body_3 in the reference script are lower on the y-axis (-6 and -9 respectively), which is a significant deviation in the simulation setup.
     - **Spring Visualization Parameters**: The spring visualization parameters differ between the two scripts (the reference uses (0.05, 80, 15) while the provided uses (0.05, 15, 10)). This is a significant detail that affects the visual representation of the springs.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - 15 points for the incorrect positioning of bodies (body_2 and body_3).
     - 10 points for incorrect spring visualization parameters.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 25 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code correctly initializes the system, bodies, and springs. However, the incorrect positioning of bodies and the spring visualization parameters could lead to a significant change in simulation behavior.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - 15 points for incorrect body positions affecting the simulation.
     - 10 points for incorrect spring visualization parameters.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable. However, it lacks comments explaining the purpose of each section, which the reference script provides more thoroughly.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - 5 points for insufficient comments.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not exhibit any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. Both scripts appear to use the PyChrono API efficiently.
   - **Deductions**: None.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: 0 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any explicit error handling or robustness checks, which are not present in the reference script either. However, the reference script is more robust in terms of body positioning.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - 5 points for lack of basic error handling or robustness.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup in the provided code is mostly correct, but the spring visualization parameters are not aligned with the reference script, which could lead to a less effective visual representation.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - 3 points for incorrect spring visualization parameters.
   - **Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools**: 3 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 25 + 25 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 3 = 63 points
- Final Score: 100 - 63 = 37

### Final Score Output

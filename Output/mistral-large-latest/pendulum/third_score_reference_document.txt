### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The reference script uses `SetGravitationalAcceleration` instead of `Set_G_acc`, which is a minor deviation but not a missing component. 
     - The reference script uses `SetFixed` and `EnableCollision` instead of `SetBodyFixed` and `SetCollide`, which are not missing but are different methods. 
     - The initialization of visual shapes uses `ChFramed` instead of `ChFrameD`, which is a minor difference.
     - The reference script initializes the revolute joint with a quaternion, while the provided script does not. This is a significant difference in joint initialization.
   - **Deductions**: 10 points for minor omissions and 10 points for incorrect configurations.
   - **Total Deductions**: 20 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: 
     - The use of `Set_G_acc` instead of `SetGravitationalAcceleration` is incorrect and could lead to confusion.
     - The joint initialization lacks the quaternion specification in the provided script, which could lead to incorrect behavior.
   - **Logical Errors**: The initial positions of the pendulums differ from the reference script, which could affect the simulation's accuracy.
   - **Deductions**: 15 points for incorrect API usage and 10 points for logical errors.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured and readable, but the variable names could be more descriptive.
   - **Comments**: The comments are adequate but could be improved for clarity and detail.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for minor readability issues and 5 points for insufficient comments.
   - **Total Deductions**: 10 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The time step in `sys.DoStepDynamics(1e-3)` is smaller than in the reference script, which uses `1e-2`. This could lead to unnecessary computations without significant benefits.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for unnecessary calculations.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Error Handling**: The provided script lacks any error handling mechanisms, which could lead to issues during execution.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of basic error handling.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the logo path uses `chrono.GetChronoDataPath()` instead of `chrono.GetChronoDataFile()`, which is a minor issue.
   - **Deductions**: 3 points for minor visualization issues.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 20 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 68 points
- Final Score: 100 - 68 = 32

### Final Score

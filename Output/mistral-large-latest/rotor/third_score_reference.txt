### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components (15 points each)**: The provided code is mostly complete, but there are some minor omissions:
     - The reference script uses `chrono.ChVector3d` instead of `chrono.ChVectorD` for 3D vectors, which is a slight deviation but not a critical omission.
     - The reference script includes a comment about the number of integration points per element when using cubic IGA, which is missing in the provided code. 
     - The reference script uses `SetShearModulusFromPoisson` instead of `SetShearModulus`, which is a more appropriate method for defining shear modulus based on Poisson's ratio.
   - **Deduction**: 10 points for minor omissions and slight deviations.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API (15 points each)**: The provided code uses `SetShearModulus` instead of `SetShearModulusFromPoisson`, which could lead to incorrect material properties. Additionally, the `SetGravitationalAcceleration` uses `chrono.ChVectorD` instead of `chrono.ChVector3d`, which is not consistent with the reference.
   - **Logical Errors (10 points)**: The motor function parameters (A1, A2, T1, T2, T3, w) are set differently in the provided code compared to the reference. This could lead to different simulation behavior.
   - **Deduction**: 15 points for incorrect API usage and 10 points for logical errors.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 to 10 points)**: The provided code is generally well-structured but lacks some comments that explain the purpose of certain sections, particularly around the motor function and the beam creation.
   - **Deduction**: 5 points for insufficient comments.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations (5 points each)**: The provided code has some redundant calculations, such as using `m.pow` instead of `pow` directly. However, these are minor and do not significantly impact performance.
   - **Deduction**: 3 points for minor inefficiencies.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling (5 points)**: The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the validity of inputs, which could lead to runtime errors.
   - **Deduction**: 5 points for lack of error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 to 5 points)**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the provided code does not include comments explaining the visualization setup, which could help in understanding the code better.
   - **Deduction**: 3 points for minor visualization issues.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 10 points
- Correctness: 25 points (15 for API usage, 10 for logical errors)
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from 100 points:
- Deductions: 10 + 25 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 3 = 51 points
- Final Score: 100 - 51 = 49

### Final Score Output

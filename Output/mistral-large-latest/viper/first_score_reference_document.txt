### Evaluation of the Provided Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks the use of a collision system type, which is present in the reference script. This is essential for accurate collision detection. **(15 points deduction)**
     - The ground body in the reference script uses a `ChContactMaterialNSC`, which is not included in the provided code. This is important for defining contact properties. **(15 points deduction)**
   - **Minor Omissions**: The provided code does not include texture for the ground body, which is present in the reference script. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: **35 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: The provided code uses `chrono.ChBody()` for the ground body, while the reference uses `chrono.ChBodyEasyBox()`, which is more efficient for creating simple shapes. This could lead to performance issues. **(15 points deduction)**
   - **Logical Errors**: The provided code initializes the rover and driver but does not correctly set the driver's properties in a way that matches the reference. The reference uses a dedicated driver class that is more appropriate for the Viper rover. **(10 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: **25 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code is reasonably structured but lacks comments explaining the purpose of various sections, which are present in the reference script. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The provided code calculates the steering change rate every loop iteration, which could be optimized. The reference script uses a more straightforward approach to manage steering. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **5 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the simulation loop, which could lead to crashes or undefined behavior. The reference script is more robust in this regard. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: **5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The provided code does not set the window title or size as effectively as the reference script, which could enhance user experience. **(3 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: **3 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 35 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
- **Total Points Deducted**: 35 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 78 points
- **Final Score**: 100 - 78 = 22

### Final Score Output

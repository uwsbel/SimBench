### Evaluation of the Provided Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script, such as system initialization, body creation, visualization setup, and sensor management. Therefore, no points are deducted in this category.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly uses the PyChrono API for the most part. However, there is a minor logical error in the simulation loop where the `step_number` is incremented after the `system.DoStepDynamics(time_step)` call. This could lead to an off-by-one error in rendering frames. Thus, **5 points** are deducted for this minor logical error.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted.**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is well-structured and readable, with appropriate variable names and formatting. However, there are some comments that could be more descriptive, especially regarding the purpose of certain sections of the code. Therefore, **5 points** are deducted for insufficient comments.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted.**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code is efficient and does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows the reference script closely in terms of efficiency. No points are deducted in this category.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which could lead to issues if the simulation encounters unexpected conditions. The reference script does not explicitly handle errors either, but it is generally good practice to include basic error handling. Therefore, **5 points** are deducted for lack of error handling.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted.**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup in the provided code is consistent with the reference script. However, there is a minor issue with the lighting setup that could be optimized. Therefore, **2 points** are deducted for minor visualization issues.
   - **Score: 2 points deducted.**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points
- Correctness: 5 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Total deductions: 0 + 5 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 2 = 17 points deducted from the total of 100 points.

Final Score: 100 - 17 = 83

### Final Score Output
[[83]]

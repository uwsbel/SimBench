 The given PyChrono script seems to be correct in terms of syntax and logic. However, there is a small issue regarding the comments. In Python, comments are denoted by the hash (#) symbol, not by double slashes (//) or double asterisks ("") as in some other languages. I have corrected the comments in the script.

Now, I will modify the script based on the provided instructions to add another beam segment using `builder.BuildBeam()`. Here is the corrected and modified script:

```python
import pychrono as chrono
import pychrono.fea as fea
import pychrono.pardisomkl as mkl
import pychrono.irrlicht as chronoirr

# Print the example description
print ("Example: PyChrono using  beam finite elements")

# Create the system
sys = chrono.ChSystemSMC()

# Create a mesh, that is a container for groups
# of elements and their referenced nodes.
mesh = fea.ChMesh()

# Create a section, i.e. thickness and material properties
# for beams. This will be shared among some beams.
msection = fea.ChBeamSectionEulerAdvanced()

beam_wy = 0.012
beam_wz = 0.025
msection.SetAsRectangularSection(beam_wy, beam_wz)
msection.SetYoungModulus(0.01e9)
msection.SetShearModulus(0.01e9 * 0.3)
msection.SetRayleighDamping(0.000)
msection.SetCentroid(0,0.02)
msection.SetShearCenter(0,0.1)
msection.SetSectionRotation(45*chrono.CH_RAD_TO_DEG)

# Add some EULER-BERNOULLI BEAMS (the fast way!)
# Shortcut!
# This ChBuilderBeamEuler helper object is very useful because it will
# subdivide 'beams' into sequences of finite elements of beam type, ex.
# one 'beam' could be made of 5 FEM elements of ChElementBeamEuler class.
# If new nodes are needed, it will create them for you.
builder = fea.ChBuilderBeamEuler()

# Now, simply use BuildBeam to create a beam from a point to another:
builder.BuildBeam(mesh,                   # the mesh where to put the created nodes and elements
                    msection,                  # the ChBeamSectionEulerAdvanced to use for the ChElementBeamEuler elements
                    5,                         # the number of ChElementBeamEuler to create
                    chrono.ChVector3d(0, 0, -0.1),   # the 'A' point in space (beginning of beam)
                    chrono.ChVector3d(0.2, 0, -0.1), # the 'B' point in space (end of beam)
                    chrono.ChVector3d(0, 1, 0))      # the 'Y' up direction of the section for the beam

# Add another beam segment using builder.BuildBeam()
last_node = builder.GetLastBeamNodes().back()
builder.BuildBeam(mesh,                   # the mesh where to put the created nodes and elements
                    msection,                  # the ChBeamSectionEulerAdvanced to use for the ChElementBeamEuler elements
                    5,                         # the number of ChElementBeamEuler to create
                    last_node.GetPos(),        # the 'A' point in space (beginning of beam) - last node created by the previous beam
                    chrono.ChVector3d(0.2, 0.1, -0.1), # the 'B' point in space (end of beam)
                    chrono.ChVector3d(0, 1, 0))      # the 'Y' up direction of the section for the beam

# ... (rest of the script remains the same)
```

In the modified script, I added a new beam segment using `builder.BuildBeam()` after the first one. The starting point ('A' node) of the new beam segment is the last node created by the previous beam, and the endpoint ('B' point) is at `(0.2, 0.1, -0.1)` with the 'Y' up direction as `(0, 1, 0)`.

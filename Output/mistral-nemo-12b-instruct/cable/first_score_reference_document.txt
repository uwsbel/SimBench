### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks the initialization of a physical system (`ChSystem`) and a mesh container (`ChMesh`), which are crucial for any simulation. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
     - The reference code uses `ChBuilderCableANCF` to create the beam, which is a more structured approach than directly creating a `ChCable`. The absence of this utility in the provided code results in another **15 points** deduction.
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The `ChCable` class is used incorrectly. The reference code uses `ChBeamSectionCable` and `ChBuilderCableANCF`, which are more appropriate for defining the beam's properties and structure. This leads to a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The `SetFixedEnd` method is used incorrectly; the parameters do not match the expected usage in the reference. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The provided code lacks comments and explanations for the various components, making it less readable compared to the reference code, which is well-structured and documented. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The loop for visualizing the beam's deformation and nodal positions is inefficient as it adds points for every node in each iteration without any optimization. The reference code uses a more efficient visualization approach. This leads to a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the simulation state, which is present in the reference code. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The visualization setup in the provided code is less comprehensive than in the reference code, which includes detailed visualization for forces and moments. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a total of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 73 points
- Final Score: 100 - 73 = 27 points

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks several essential components present in the reference script:
     - **Gravity Setting**: The reference script sets gravitational acceleration, which is crucial for realistic simulations. The provided code does not include this, resulting in a deduction of **15 points**.
     - **Collision System Type**: The reference script specifies a collision system type (BULLET), which is important for performance and accuracy. The provided code does not set this, leading to another **15 points** deduction.
     - **Visualization Setup**: The reference script includes a visualization setup using Irrlicht, which is completely absent in the provided code. This results in a **15 points** deduction.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: **45 points** (over the maximum, capped at 40).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The provided code uses `chrono.ChSimulation()` instead of `chrono.ChSystemNSC()` or `chrono.ChSystemSMC()`, which are the correct initializations for a simulation system. This leads to a **15 points** deduction.
   - **Logical Errors**: The code initializes contacts between bodies but does not properly configure the contact materials or the collision system, which could lead to unexpected behavior. This results in a **10 points** deduction.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is relatively well-structured, but it lacks meaningful comments explaining the purpose of various sections, which are present in the reference script. This results in a **5 points** deduction.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Redundant Code**: The code redundantly creates multiple contact links without checking if they are necessary, which could be optimized. This leads to a **5 points** deduction.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for successful initialization of bodies or contacts, which is a significant oversight. This results in a **5 points** deduction.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The provided code does not utilize any visualization tools, which are crucial for observing simulation results. This results in a **5 points** deduction.
   - **Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools**: **5 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: **40 points**
- Correctness: **25 points**
- Code Quality: **5 points**
- Efficiency: **5 points**
- Error Handling and Robustness: **5 points**
- Use of Visualization Tools: **5 points**

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a total of 100 points:
- Deductions: 40 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = **85 points**
- Final Score: 100 - 85 = **15 points**

### Final Score Output

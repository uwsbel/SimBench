### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **System Initialization**: The provided code initializes the physics engine and creates a system, which is present in the reference. However, it lacks the gravitational acceleration setup that is present in the reference script. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Body Creation**: The provided code creates a ground and a mass, but the mass is a sphere instead of a box as in the reference. Additionally, the ground is not fixed, which is a significant difference. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Visualization**: The provided code has basic visualization elements, but it lacks the detailed camera setup and lighting that the reference script includes. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 35 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **API Usage**: The provided code uses `chrono.ChLinkTSDA.StiffnessDefault()` and `chrono.ChLinkTSDA.DampingDefault()`, which are not standard methods for setting spring coefficients and damping coefficients. This is a significant deviation from the reference script. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors**: The initialization of the spring connection is not correctly set up as per the reference. The reference script uses relative positions for the spring, while the provided code does not. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code is relatively readable, but it lacks comments explaining the purpose of various sections, which are present in the reference. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The provided code does not appear to have significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, the way the spring is visualized could be optimized. **(Deduct 3 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: 3 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are not explicitly present in the reference but are generally a good practice. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The provided code has a basic visualization setup but lacks the detailed elements such as logo, skybox, and proper camera setup that the reference script includes. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: 5 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 35 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 35 + 25 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 5 = 78 points
- Final Score: 100 - 78 = 22 points

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks a proper gravitational setup (`sys.SetGravitationalAcceleration(...)`), which is present in the reference script. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - The reference script uses a fixed ground body, while the provided code uses a box that is not fixed. This could lead to different simulation behavior. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The spring-damper connection is initialized with incorrect parameters compared to the reference script. The reference script uses `chrono.ChLinkTSDA()` with specific initialization parameters that are not correctly mirrored in the provided code. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The spring-damper properties (stiffness and damping) are set using default methods, which may not be appropriate for the intended simulation. The reference script explicitly sets these values. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The provided code lacks meaningful variable names and comments that explain the purpose of each section. The reference script is better documented. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The provided code includes a visual shape for the spring that is not present in the reference script, which may not be necessary for the simulation. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the simulation state, which is present in the reference script. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code does not set up the visualization as comprehensively as the reference script (e.g., missing logo, skybox, and camera settings). **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 75 points
- Final Score: 100 - 75 = 25 points

### Final Score Output

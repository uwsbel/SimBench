### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. However, there are minor deviations in the force functor implementation and the way the spring forces are registered.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - **5 points** for minor deviations in the force functor implementation (the reference uses a different method signature for `evaluate`).
     - **5 points** for using `AddForceFunctor` instead of `RegisterForceFunctor` for `spring_2`.
   - **Total Deductions**: 10 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code generally follows the correct API usage, but there are some inaccuracies:
     - The `Evaluate` method in `MySpringForce` does not match the expected parameters in the reference script.
     - The spring force calculation does not consider the current length of the spring, which could lead to incorrect simulation behavior.
   - **Deductions**:
     - **15 points** for incorrect use of the `Evaluate` method.
     - **10 points** for logical errors in the spring force calculation.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is relatively readable, but it lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of each section and the parameters used in the force functor.
   - **Deductions**:
     - **5 points** for insufficient comments and lack of clarity in the force functor.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, the use of a custom force functor could be optimized further.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - **3 points** for minor optimization opportunities that could be implemented.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which could lead to issues during execution.
   - **Deductions**:
     - **5 points** for lack of basic error handling.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor issues with the way visual shapes are added.
   - **Deductions**:
     - **2 points** for minor visualization issues.
   - **Total Deductions**: 2 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 10 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 10 + 25 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 50 points
- Final Score: 100 - 50 = 50

### Final Score Output
[[50]]

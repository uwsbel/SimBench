### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **System Initialization**: The provided code initializes the PyChrono environment but does not create a `ChSystem` object, which is essential for managing the simulation. This results in a **15-point deduction**.
   - **Body Creation**: The ground and pendulum bodies are created, but the ground body is not fixed, and the pendulum lacks collision settings. This results in a **10-point deduction**.
   - **Visualization**: The visualization setup is incomplete. The reference script includes a comprehensive visualization setup with a camera, lights, and a logo, which is missing in the provided code. This results in a **15-point deduction**.
   - **Logging**: The logging mechanism is present but lacks the detail and structure of the reference script. This results in a **5-point deduction**.

   **Total Deductions for Completeness: 15 + 10 + 15 + 5 = 55 points** (Exceeds 40 points, capped at 40)

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **API Usage**: The use of `ChApp` for visualization is incorrect as it does not properly integrate with the simulation system. This results in a **15-point deduction**.
   - **Joint Initialization**: The joint initialization is not configured correctly compared to the reference script, which uses `ChLinkLockRevolute`. This results in a **10-point deduction**.
   - **Body Properties**: The inertia tensor for the pendulum is set incorrectly. The reference script uses a different configuration. This results in a **10-point deduction**.

   **Total Deductions for Correctness: 15 + 10 + 10 = 35 points** (Exceeds 30 points, capped at 30)

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code lacks clear structure and meaningful variable names. The organization is not as clear as in the reference script. This results in a **5-point deduction**.
   - **Comments**: There are insufficient comments explaining the code, especially compared to the reference script, which is well-documented. This results in a **5-point deduction**.

   **Total Deductions for Code Quality: 5 + 5 = 10 points** (Capped at 10)

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Redundant Code**: The simulation loop and logging mechanism are less efficient than in the reference script. This results in a **5-point deduction**.
   - **Optimization Opportunities**: There are several areas where the code could be optimized, such as the way the visualization is set up. This results in a **3-point deduction**.

   **Total Deductions for Efficiency: 5 + 3 = 8 points** (Capped at 10)

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Error Handling**: The provided code lacks basic error handling and robustness checks that are present in the reference script. This results in a **5-point deduction**.

   **Total Deductions for Error Handling: 5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is inadequate compared to the reference script, which includes a more comprehensive setup. This results in a **5-point deduction**.

   **Total Deductions for Visualization: 5 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points
- Correctness: 30 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 8 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Deductions: 40 + 30 + 10 + 8 + 5 + 5 = 98 points

Final Score: 100 - 98 = 2 points

### Final Score Output

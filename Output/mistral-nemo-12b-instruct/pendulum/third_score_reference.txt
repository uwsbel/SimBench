### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code is mostly complete but has some minor deviations from the reference script. 
   - **Deductions:**
     - **5 points** for the naming inconsistency in visual shapes (cyl_ground vs. cyl_1, cyl_pend_1 vs. cyl_1).
     - **5 points** for the initial position of the second pendulum being set to (2, 0, 1) instead of (3, 0, 1) as in the reference.
     - **5 points** for the time step in `sys.Do_Step_Dynamics(1e-3)` being different from the reference's `sys.DoStepDynamics(1e-2)`, which could affect simulation behavior.
   - Total Deductions: **15 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code uses the PyChrono API correctly in most cases, but there are some logical errors.
   - **Deductions:**
     - **10 points** for the incorrect initialization of the second pendulum's joint position (should be (2, 0, 1) instead of (0, 0, 1)).
     - **5 points** for the incorrect time step in the simulation loop, which could lead to different simulation dynamics.
   - Total Deductions: **15 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally readable, but there are some areas for improvement in variable naming and comments.
   - **Deductions:**
     - **5 points** for the lack of meaningful comments explaining the purpose of certain sections, especially around joint initialization and visualization setup.
   - Total Deductions: **5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code is efficient but could be optimized in terms of the time step used in the simulation.
   - **Deductions:**
     - **3 points** for using a smaller time step (1e-3) compared to the reference (1e-2), which may lead to unnecessary computations.
   - Total Deductions: **3 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling or robustness checks.
   - **Deductions:**
     - **5 points** for the lack of basic error handling or checks that could prevent runtime issues.
   - Total Deductions: **5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct but has some minor issues.
   - **Deductions:**
     - **3 points** for minor inconsistencies in naming conventions and the absence of a specific title for the simulation window.
   - Total Deductions: **3 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 15 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 46 points
- Final Score: 100 - 46 = 54

### Final Score Output

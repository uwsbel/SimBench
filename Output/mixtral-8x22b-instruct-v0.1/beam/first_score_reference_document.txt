### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks the creation of a mesh (`fea.ChMesh()`) and the use of a section object for beam properties (`fea.ChBeamSectionEulerAdvanced()`), which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points** for each missing essential component.
     - The provided code does not apply forces or torques to the nodes, which is a significant omission compared to the reference script. This results in an additional deduction of **15 points**.
     - Total deductions: **45 points** (3 components missing).
   
2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The provided code uses `chrono.ChSystemNSC()` while the reference uses `chrono.ChSystemSMC()`, which is more suitable for FEA simulations. This leads to a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The provided code does not set the beam section properties, which is critical for defining the beam's mechanical properties. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
     - Total deductions: **25 points** (1 incorrect API usage, 1 logical error).

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The provided code is relatively clear, but it lacks comments explaining the purpose of each section, which is present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - Total deductions: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The provided code does not demonstrate any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script, but it could benefit from better organization and structure. However, no explicit inefficiencies are noted, so no deductions are applied here.
   - Total deductions: **0 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for successful initialization, which is a basic requirement for robustness. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - Total deductions: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code does not utilize advanced visualization features such as visual shapes for the mesh and nodes, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - Total deductions: **5 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: **45 points**
- Correctness: **25 points**
- Code Quality: **5 points**
- Efficiency: **0 points**
- Error Handling and Robustness: **5 points**
- Use of Visualization Tools: **5 points**

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total deductions: 45 + 25 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 5 = **85 points**
- Final Score: 100 - 85 = **15 points**

### Final Score Output

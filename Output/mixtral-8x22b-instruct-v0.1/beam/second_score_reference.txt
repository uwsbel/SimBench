### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code does not include the creation of individual beam elements using `ChElementBeamEuler`, which is present in the reference script. Instead, it uses a builder to create beams, which is a different approach. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Minor Omissions or Deviations (5 points each)**: 
     - The force applied to `hnode2` in the reference script is set to `(4, 2, 0)`, while in the provided code, it is set to `(0, -1, 0)`. This is a significant deviation in the force application. Deduct **5 points** for this difference.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: **20 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of PyChrono API (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code uses `builder.BuildBeam()` which is a higher-level function that abstracts away the creation of individual elements. While this is not incorrect, it does not match the reference's explicit creation of elements, which could lead to confusion about the structure of the mesh. Deduct **15 points** for this.
   - **Logical Errors (10 points)**: 
     - The force application on `hnode2` is not consistent with the reference script, which could lead to different simulation behavior. Deduct **10 points** for this logical error.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 to 10 points)**: 
     - The provided code is generally well-structured and readable, but the use of comments could be improved to match the clarity of the reference script. Deduct **5 points** for insufficient comments.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations or Redundant Code (5 points each)**: 
     - The provided code does not appear to have significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, the use of the builder could be seen as less efficient if it creates unnecessary nodes or elements. Deduct **3 points** for this potential inefficiency.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **3 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are important for robustness. Deduct **5 points** for this lack.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Incorrect or Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 to 5 points)**: 
     - The visualization setup in the provided code is mostly consistent with the reference script, but there are minor differences in the details of the visualization parameters. Deduct **3 points** for these minor differences.
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 20 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 20 + 25 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 3 = 61 points
- Final Score: 100 - 61 = 39

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the Provided Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code is missing several essential components that are present in the reference script:
     - **System Initialization**: The provided code does not initialize a physical system (`ChSystemSMC`), which is crucial for any simulation. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - **Body Creation**: There are no bodies created or added to the system, which is a significant omission. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - **Visualization Setup**: The provided code lacks any visualization setup, which is critical for observing the simulation. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - Total Deductions for Completeness: **45 points** (but capped at 40 points).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code does not utilize any PyChrono API correctly since it lacks the necessary components for a functional simulation. Thus, it cannot be evaluated for correctness in terms of API usage or logical errors. **(Deduct 15 points)** for the absence of a functional simulation structure.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks any comments or documentation, making it difficult to understand its purpose or functionality. **(Deduct 5 points)** for insufficient comments.
   - The structure is minimal and lacks meaningful variable names or formatting. **(Deduct 5 points)** for poor readability and structure.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not contain any calculations or logic that can be evaluated for efficiency. However, the absence of a complete simulation means it cannot be optimized. **(Deduct 5 points)** for the lack of any efficient use of APIs or calculations.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - There is no error handling or robustness in the provided code due to its incomplete nature. **(Deduct 5 points)** for the lack of basic error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not utilize any visualization tools, which is a significant shortcoming. **(Deduct 5 points)** for inadequate visualization setup.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a total of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 40 + 15 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 80 points
- Final Score: 100 - 80 = 20 points

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the Provided Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script, such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. However, there are minor deviations in the comments and dimensions of some visual shapes.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - **5 points** for minor deviations in comments and dimensions of visual shapes.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly uses the PyChrono API in most instances. However, there are some discrepancies in the dimensions of visual shapes and the number of elements in the beam construction, which could affect the simulation behavior.
   - **Deductions**:
     - **10 points** for logical errors in the dimensions of visual shapes and the number of elements, which could lead to a significant change in simulation behavior.
   - **Total Deductions**: 10 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, with appropriate comments. However, there are some areas where comments could be more descriptive.
   - **Deductions**:
     - **5 points** for insufficient comments in certain sections that could enhance understanding.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. It uses the PyChrono API effectively without unnecessary calculations.
   - **Deductions**: None.
   - **Total Deductions**: 0 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include explicit error handling mechanisms, which could be important for robustness.
   - **Deductions**:
     - **5 points** for lack of basic error handling.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor issues with the scale of glyphs and lighting that could be improved.
   - **Deductions**:
     - **3 points** for minor visualization issues, such as suboptimal lighting and glyph scaling.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 10 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 5 + 10 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 3 = 28 points
- Final Score: 100 - 28 = 72 points

### Final Score Output
[[72]]

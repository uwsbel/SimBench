### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. However, the long box obstacle in the reference script is replaced with a different box configuration in the provided code, which is a significant deviation. This results in a **15-point deduction** for missing the specific obstacle configuration.
   - **Points Deducted: 15**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code uses the PyChrono API correctly, but the obstacle's dimensions and material properties differ from the reference. This could lead to a significant change in simulation behavior. Thus, a **15-point deduction** is warranted for this incorrect use of the API.
   - **Points Deducted: 15**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. However, the comments are slightly less descriptive than in the reference script, which could lead to confusion for someone unfamiliar with the code. A **5-point deduction** is appropriate here.
   - **Points Deducted: 5**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not exhibit any unnecessary calculations or redundant code compared to the reference. It follows a similar structure and efficiency. No deductions are necessary in this category.
   - **Points Deducted: 0**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks explicit error handling, which is not addressed in the reference script either. However, since the reference does not handle any edge cases, a **3-point deduction** is reasonable for not accounting for potential issues.
   - **Points Deducted: 3**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is similar to the reference script, with no significant issues. However, the comment regarding shadows is less clear than in the reference. A **2-point deduction** is appropriate for this minor visualization issue.
   - **Points Deducted: 2**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 15 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 3 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 15 + 15 + 5 + 0 + 3 + 2 = 40
- Final Score: 100 - 40 = 60

### Final Score
[[60]]

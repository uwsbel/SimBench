### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided script is missing the creation of `body_2` and `body_3` visualization assets, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points** for each missing visualization asset.
   - **Incorrect Configuration**: The positions of `body_2` and `body_3` in the provided script are incorrect compared to the reference script. The reference places `body_2` at `(-1, -6, 0)` and `body_3` at `(-1, -9, 0)`, while the provided script places them at `(0, -3, 0)` and `(1, -3, 0)`, respectively. This results in a deduction of **10 points** for incorrect configuration.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 15 (body_2 visualization) + 15 (body_3 visualization) + 10 (incorrect body positions) = **40 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The initialization of springs between bodies is incorrect. The reference script connects `spring_1` to `body_1` and `ground`, while the provided script connects it to `body_1` and `body_2`. This leads to a significant change in simulation behavior, resulting in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: The initialization of `spring_2` is also incorrect as it connects `body_2` to `body_3` instead of `body_1`. This results in another deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 15 (incorrect spring connection) + 10 (logical error in spring connection) = **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided script is generally readable, but it lacks comments that explain the purpose of each section, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points** for insufficient comments.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The provided script does not exhibit significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script, so no deductions are warranted here.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **0 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided script does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are not explicitly present in the reference script either. However, since this is a basic simulation setup, a deduction of **3 points** for inadequate handling of potential issues is reasonable.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling**: **3 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The provided script has a similar visualization setup to the reference script, but it lacks the additional visual shapes for `body_2` and `body_3`. This results in a deduction of **3 points** for inadequate visualization setup.
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling: 3 points
- Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 40 + 25 + 5 + 0 + 3 + 3 = 76 points
- Final Score: 100 - 76 = **24 points**

### Final Score Output

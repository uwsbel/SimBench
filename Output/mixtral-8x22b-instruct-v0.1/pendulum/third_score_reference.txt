### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code is missing the logging of the second pendulum's position and velocity, which is present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Incorrect Configuration (10 points)**: 
     - The reference script uses `chrono.ChFramed` and `chrono.ChQuaterniond` for frame and quaternion initialization, while the provided code uses `chrono.ChFrameD` and `chrono.Q_from_AngY`. This is a significant deviation in terms of API usage, leading to a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Minor Omissions (5 points)**: 
     - The window title in the provided code is "ChBodyAuxRef demo", while the reference script uses "Double Pendulum Simulation". This is a minor deviation, resulting in a deduction of **5 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Completeness: 30 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API (15 points)**: 
     - The use of `chrono.ChFrameD` and `chrono.Q_from_AngY` instead of `chrono.ChFramed` and `chrono.QuatFromAngleY` is incorrect and could lead to significant changes in simulation behavior. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors (10 points)**: 
     - The initial position of the second pendulum is set to (2, 0, 1) in the provided code, while it is set to (3, 0, 1) in the reference script. This is a logical error in the setup of the pendulum positions, leading to a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Minor Inaccuracies (5 points)**: 
     - The time step for `sys.DoStepDynamics` is set to `1e-3` in the provided code, while the reference script uses `1e-2`. This is a minor inaccuracy, resulting in a deduction of **5 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Correctness: 30 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 points)**: 
     - The overall structure of the code is clear, but the variable naming and comments could be improved for better readability. However, it is not significantly poor, so a deduction of **5 points** is applied.
   - **Insufficient Comments (5 points)**: 
     - The comments are generally adequate, but they could be more descriptive in some areas. No additional deduction is applied here.

   **Total Deductions for Code Quality: 5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code has no significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. No deductions are applied here.
   - **Missing Optimization Opportunities (3 points)**: 
     - There are no clear optimization opportunities that are missed in the provided code. No deductions are applied here.

   **Total Deductions for Efficiency: 0 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are not explicitly present in the reference script either. However, this is a common practice that should be included. A deduction of **5 points** is applied.

   **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 points)**: 
     - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the color of the second pendulum is different from the reference script. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Minor Visualization Issues (2 points)**: 
     - There are no significant minor issues, so no additional deductions are applied here.

   **Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 30 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 30 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 3 = 73 points
- Final Score: 100 - 73 = 27 points

**Final Score: [[27]]**

### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. However, the gravity setting in the reference script is noted as "Changed gravity," which suggests that the provided script may not match the reference in terms of the exact gravitational acceleration value. This is a minor deviation but still counts as a slight omission.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for the minor deviation in gravity setting.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code uses the PyChrono API correctly in most instances. However, the reference script mentions "Changed flywheel radius," indicating that the flywheel's dimensions may differ from the reference. This could lead to significant changes in simulation behavior.
   - **Deductions**: 15 points for the incorrect use of the flywheel dimensions.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names and appropriate comments. However, there are some areas where comments could be more detailed, especially in complex sections like the motor initialization.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit any unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows the reference script closely in terms of efficiency.
   - **Deductions**: 0 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks explicit error handling mechanisms. The reference script does not indicate any error handling either, but it is generally good practice to include checks for potential issues, especially in simulations.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of basic error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is consistent with the reference script, and all necessary components are included. There are no significant issues with the visualization tools used.
   - **Deductions**: 0 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 0 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total deductions: 30 points
- Final score: 100 - 30 = 70

**Final Score**: [[70]]

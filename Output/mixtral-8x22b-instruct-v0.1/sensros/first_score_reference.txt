### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components (15 points each)**: The provided code lacks several essential components present in the reference script:
     - The reference script includes a camera sensor, lidar sensor, GPS sensor, accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer, which are all missing in the provided code. This results in a deduction of 15 points for each missing sensor, totaling **90 points**.
   - **Minor Omissions (5 points each)**: The provided code does not include any visualization shapes for the mesh object, which is present in the reference script. This results in an additional deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 90 + 5 = **95 points** (exceeds the total available points, capped at 40).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API (15 points each)**: The provided code does not correctly set up the mesh object as a visual shape attached to a body, which is critical for visualization. This is a significant deviation from the reference script. Deduction: **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors (10 points)**: The ground body is created but lacks the proper properties (e.g., mass set to 0 for static objects). Deduction: **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 15 + 10 = **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 to 10 points)**: The code is relatively straightforward but lacks meaningful comments and structure compared to the reference script. Deduction: **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations or Redundant Code (5 points each)**: The provided code does not contain any unnecessary calculations or redundant code, but it also lacks optimizations present in the reference script. Deduction: **3 points** for missing optimization opportunities.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **3 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling (5 points)**: The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are present in the reference script. Deduction: **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 to 5 points)**: The provided code does not set up any visualization tools or lighting, which are present in the reference script. Deduction: **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: **5 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points (capped)
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Total Score Calculation
Starting from 100 points:
- Deductions: 40 (Completeness) + 25 (Correctness) + 5 (Code Quality) + 3 (Efficiency) + 5 (Error Handling) + 5 (Visualization Tools) = 83 points

Final Score: 100 - 83 = **17 points**.

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **System Initialization**: The system is initialized correctly using `chrono.ChSystemNSC()`, and collision settings are appropriately configured. **(0 points deducted)**
   - **Body Creation**: The ground and robot bodies are created and added to the system. The ground body is fixed, which is correct. **(0 points deducted)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization system is set up properly, including camera and lighting configurations. **(0 points deducted)**
   - **Overall**: All essential components are present and correctly configured. **(0 points deducted)**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **API Usage**: The API is used correctly throughout the script. The robot's motor speeds are set appropriately based on the mode. **(0 points deducted)**
   - **Logical Errors**: There are no logical errors in the code that would significantly affect the simulation behavior. **(0 points deducted)**
   - **Overall**: The script is logically sound and adheres to the API documentation. **(0 points deducted)**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. **(0 points deducted)**
   - **Comments**: While there are some comments, they could be more detailed to explain the purpose of certain sections, especially in the movement function. **(5 points deducted)**
   - **Overall**: Minor deductions for insufficient comments. **(5 points deducted)**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: There are no unnecessary calculations or redundant code present. **(0 points deducted)**
   - **Optimization Opportunities**: The simulation loop could be optimized by using a more efficient way to determine the mode of movement rather than checking time conditions in each iteration. **(3 points deducted)**
   - **Overall**: Minor deductions for optimization opportunities. **(3 points deducted)**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Basic Error Handling**: The `move` function raises a `ValueError` for invalid modes, which is good practice. **(0 points deducted)**
   - **Edge Cases**: The script does not handle potential edge cases, such as what happens if the simulation runs indefinitely or if the robot encounters an unexpected condition. **(3 points deducted)**
   - **Overall**: Minor deductions for inadequate handling of edge cases. **(3 points deducted)**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the lighting could be improved for better visibility. **(3 points deducted)**
   - **Minor Issues**: The logo and skybox are added, which is good, but there could be more attention to detail in the lighting setup. **(2 points deducted)**
   - **Overall**: Minor deductions for lighting issues. **(3 points deducted)**

### Final Score Calculation
- **Completeness**: 0 points deducted
- **Correctness**: 0 points deducted
- **Code Quality**: 5 points deducted
- **Efficiency**: 3 points deducted
- **Error Handling and Robustness**: 3 points deducted
- **Use of Visualization Tools**: 3 points deducted

Total deductions: 14 points

Final score: 100 - 14 = 86

### Final Score Output
[[86]] 

### Explanation of Deductions
- Minor deductions were made for insufficient comments, optimization opportunities, inadequate handling of edge cases, and minor visualization issues. Overall, the script is well-structured and adheres to the PyChrono API documentation effectively.

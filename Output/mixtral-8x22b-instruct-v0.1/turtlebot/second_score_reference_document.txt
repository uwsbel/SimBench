### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. However, the `move` function in the provided code does not define the `LEFT_DRIVE_WHEEL` and `RIGHT_DRIVE_WHEEL` constants within the function scope, which is a minor omission. 
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for minor omissions.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The robot's motor control logic is slightly different from the reference script. The reference script uses different motor speeds for turning left and right, while the provided code uses a constant speed for straight movement and a different approach for turning. This could lead to a significant change in simulation behavior.
   - **Deductions**: 15 points for incorrect use of the PyChrono API that could lead to a significant change in simulation behavior.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable. However, there are some comments that could be more descriptive, especially in the `move` function. The variable names are meaningful, but the lack of comments explaining the purpose of the `move` function and its parameters could be improved.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit any unnecessary calculations or redundant code. However, the `move` function could be optimized by defining the wheel constants outside the function to avoid redefining them every time the function is called.
   - **Deductions**: 3 points for missing obvious optimization opportunities.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code includes basic error handling in the `move` function, raising a `ValueError` for invalid modes. This is adequate, but the reference script does not include any additional error handling for edge cases.
   - **Deductions**: 0 points (no deductions necessary).

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the provided code does not include a specific comment about enabling shadows, which is present in the reference script. This could be considered a minor visualization issue.
   - **Deductions**: 2 points for minor visualization issues.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 0 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a total of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 5 + 15 + 5 + 3 + 0 + 2 = 30 points
- Final Score: 100 - 30 = 70

### Final Score Output
[[70]]

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks the creation of a physical system (`ChSystemSMC`), which is essential for any simulation. This is a significant omission. **(-15 points)**
     - The provided code does not include the creation of a FEM mesh container (`ChMesh`) or the detailed setup of beam sections and constraints as seen in the reference. **(-15 points)**
     - The visualization setup is not as comprehensive as in the reference code, which includes additional visual elements and settings. **(-5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: **-35 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: 
     - The use of `ChFunction_Constant` is incorrect as it does not match the custom motor function implementation in the reference. This could lead to significant differences in simulation behavior. **(-15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The constraints and body properties are not set up correctly compared to the reference, which may lead to incorrect simulation results. **(-10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: **-25 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The code lacks meaningful variable names and comments that explain the purpose of various components. The structure is less organized compared to the reference. **(-5 points)**
   - **Documentation**: 
     - There are insufficient comments to guide the reader through the code. **(-5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: **-10 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The code has redundant calls and lacks optimizations present in the reference script, such as the use of specific solver types and timestep settings. **(-5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: **-5 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are present in the reference script. **(-5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: **-5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The visualization setup is minimal and does not include features such as lighting, camera setup, or additional visual elements that enhance the simulation experience. **(-5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: **-5 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: **-35 points**
- Correctness: **-25 points**
- Code Quality: **-10 points**
- Efficiency: **-5 points**
- Error Handling and Robustness: **-5 points**
- Use of Visualization Tools: **-5 points**

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a full score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: **-85 points**
- Final Score: **100 - 85 = 15**

### Final Score Output

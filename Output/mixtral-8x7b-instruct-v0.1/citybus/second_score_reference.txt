### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code is missing the initialization of the driver system. The reference script uses `ChInteractiveDriverIRR` for driver input, which is not present in the provided code. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Incorrect Configuration**: The provided code initializes a `ChDataDriver` but does not properly set up the driver inputs as done in the reference script. This is a significant omission, leading to another deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 + 10 = **25 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The provided code does not correctly synchronize the driver inputs with the vehicle, as it uses `driver` instead of `driver_inputs` in the `vehicle.Synchronize` method. This is a significant error, leading to a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: The provided code does not print the vehicle mass, which is included in the reference script. This is a minor logical error, leading to a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 + 5 = **20 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code is generally readable, but it lacks some comments that would help clarify the purpose of certain sections, especially around the driver initialization. This leads to a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Redundant Code**: The provided code has unnecessary calculations in the driver setup that are not optimized as in the reference script. This leads to a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are present in the reference script. This leads to a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The provided code does not include the same level of detail in visualization setup as the reference script, particularly in terms of driver input handling. This leads to a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 20 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a full score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 25 + 20 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = **63 points**
- Final Score: 100 - 63 = **37 points**

### Final Score Output

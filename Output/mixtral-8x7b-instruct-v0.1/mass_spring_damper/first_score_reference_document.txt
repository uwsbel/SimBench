### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks the initialization of the simulation system (`ChSystemNSC` or similar), which is present in the reference script. This is a critical component for any simulation. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - The reference script includes a visualization setup that adds a logo, skybox, and typical lights, which are not present in the provided code. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The code uses `RigidBody` instead of `ChBody`, which is incorrect as `RigidBody` is not a valid class in the PyChrono API. This could lead to significant changes in simulation behavior. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - The mass body is added using `my_application.addBody(mass_box)` where `mass_box` is not defined; it should be `mass_body`. This is a logical error. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The code lacks meaningful comments and documentation, making it harder to understand the purpose of each section. The reference script is better structured and documented. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations or Redundant Code**: 
     - The provided code does not show any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script, but it does not utilize the best practices for defining bodies and links. **(Deduct 3 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms or checks for successful initialization of bodies and links, which is a common practice in robust simulations. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code does not include a complete visualization setup as seen in the reference script, such as adding a logo, skybox, and typical lights. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 25 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 5 = 73 points
- Final Score: 100 - 73 = 27

### Final Score Output
[[27]]

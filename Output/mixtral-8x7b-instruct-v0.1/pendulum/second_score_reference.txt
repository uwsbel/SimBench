### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks several essential components present in the reference script:
     - **System Initialization**: The initialization of the Chrono simulation system (`sys = chrono.ChSystemNSC()`) is missing. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - **Ground Body Creation**: The creation and configuration of the ground body is absent. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - **Pendulum Body Creation**: The pendulum body creation and its properties (mass, inertia, initial position) are not included. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - **Joint Creation**: The spherical joint connecting the pendulum to the ground is missing. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - **Visualization Setup**: The setup for the visualization system (Irrlicht) is not present. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - Total deductions for completeness: **75 points** (exceeds maximum, capped at 40 points).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code does not contain any incorrect uses of the PyChrono API since it does not implement the necessary components. However, the absence of critical elements like body creation and joint initialization leads to a logical error in the simulation setup. **(Deduct 10 points)** for the logical error of not initializing the pendulum and ground correctly.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks structure and documentation, as it is incomplete and does not follow the reference script's organization. **(Deduct 10 points)** for poor readability and lack of meaningful comments.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not contain any unnecessary calculations or redundant code since it is incomplete. However, the absence of the full simulation setup means it cannot be evaluated for efficiency. **(Deduct 3 points)** for missing optimization opportunities that the reference script implements.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - There is no error handling or robustness in the provided code due to its incomplete nature. **(Deduct 5 points)** for the lack of basic error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not utilize any visualization tools, which are crucial for the simulation. **(Deduct 5 points)** for inadequate visualization setup.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points (capped)
- Correctness: 10 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from 100 points:
- Deductions: 40 (Completeness) + 10 (Correctness) + 10 (Code Quality) + 3 (Efficiency) + 5 (Error Handling) + 5 (Visualization) = 73 points
- Final Score: 100 - 73 = 27

### Final Score Output

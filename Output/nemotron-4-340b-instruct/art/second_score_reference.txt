### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script. There are no missing components, and all necessary initializations and configurations are present.
   - **Score Deduction**: 0 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code uses the PyChrono API correctly, and there are no significant changes in simulation behavior due to incorrect API usage.
   - There are no logical errors or incorrect settings of body properties compared to the reference script.
   - **Score Deduction**: 0 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. The formatting is consistent with the reference script.
   - However, there are some minor comments that could be improved for clarity, but they do not significantly detract from the overall quality.
   - **Score Deduction**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It efficiently uses the APIs similar to the reference script.
   - There are no obvious optimization opportunities that are missed, as the code follows the reference closely.
   - **Score Deduction**: 0 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. While it may not be strictly necessary for a simulation script, the absence of basic error handling is noted.
   - **Score Deduction**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is consistent with the reference script, and all necessary visual elements are included.
   - There are no significant issues with the visualization tools used.
   - **Score Deduction**: 0 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points
- Correctness: 0 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 0 points

### Final Score Calculation
Total points deducted: 5 (Code Quality) + 5 (Error Handling) = 10 points deducted from a total of 100.

Final Score: 100 - 10 = 90

### Final Score Output
[[90]]

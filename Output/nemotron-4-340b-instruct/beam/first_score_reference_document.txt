### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks several essential components present in the reference script:
     - **Mesh Creation**: The reference script uses a `ChMesh` to contain nodes and elements, while the provided code directly adds nodes and elements to the system without a mesh container. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - **Beam Section Configuration**: The reference script defines a rectangular beam section with specific dimensions, while the provided code uses a basic `ChBeamSectionAdvanced` without specifying its shape. **(Deduct 10 points)**
     - **Constraints**: The reference script includes constraints to connect nodes to a fixed truss, which is absent in the provided code. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 40 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The provided code uses `chrono.ChNodeFEAxyzD` instead of `fea.ChNodeFEAxyzrot`, which is more appropriate for nodes in a finite element analysis context. This could lead to incorrect simulation behavior. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Force Application**: The force applied to `node_B` is not consistent with the reference script, which applies both a force and a torque. This omission could lead to significant differences in simulation results. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code is relatively straightforward but lacks comments explaining the purpose of various sections. The reference script has better documentation and structure. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The provided code initializes the system and adds elements without leveraging a mesh, which is less efficient for larger simulations. The reference script is optimized for such scenarios. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are present in the reference script. This could lead to issues during execution. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The provided code initializes visualization but lacks additional visual elements like logos, skyboxes, and lighting that enhance the visual experience in the reference script. **(Deduct 3 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 40 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 83 points
- Final Score: 100 - 83 = 17

### Final Score Output

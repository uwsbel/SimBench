### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: 
     - The provided code does not create a beam section with material properties, which is present in the reference script. This is a significant omission as it affects the physical properties of the beam. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - The provided code does not include the creation of nodes and elements in a detailed manner as in the reference script. Instead, it relies on the `ChBuilderBeamEuler` for the beam creation but does not define the section properties beforehand. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 30 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of PyChrono API**: 
     - The provided code uses `SetFixed(True)` on the last node, which is not consistent with the reference script's approach of using constraints for fixing nodes. This could lead to differences in simulation behavior. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The force applied to the first node is set correctly, but the reference script applies a torque to the third node, which is not present in the provided code. This could lead to a significant change in the simulation behavior. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The provided code is generally readable, but it lacks some comments that explain the purpose of certain sections, especially regarding the constraints and force applications. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations or Redundant Code**: 
     - The provided code does not seem to have significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script, but it could benefit from a more structured approach to node and element creation. However, no explicit inefficiencies were noted. **(No deductions)**
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: 0 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms or checks for the success of operations, which could lead to issues during execution. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the provided code does not include the `SetAutomaticGravity(False)` line, which is present in the reference script. This could lead to unintended effects in the simulation. **(Deduct 3 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 25 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 3 = 68 points
- Final Score: 100 - 68 = 32 points

### Final Score Output

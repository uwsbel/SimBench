### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. However, there are minor deviations in the use of semicolons and spacing that are not consistent with the reference script.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - **5 points** for minor omissions or slight deviations (e.g., unnecessary semicolons in the reference script).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly implements the PyChrono API for creating a finite element analysis simulation. However, there is a logical error in the force application to the nodes. The reference script applies a force to the front node of the last beam created, while the provided code applies it to a different node.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - **10 points** for logical errors in the code (incorrect application of forces).

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. However, there are some inconsistencies in spacing and formatting compared to the reference script.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - **5 points** for insufficient comments or failure to follow documentation best practices, as the reference script provides better documentation.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code is efficient and does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows the reference script closely in terms of efficiency.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - **0 points** for efficiency.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks explicit error handling, which is not addressed in the reference script either. However, it does not account for potential issues that could arise during simulation.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - **5 points** for lack of basic error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor issues with the configuration of visual elements compared to the reference script.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - **3 points** for incorrect or inadequate visualization setup.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: -5 points
- Correctness: -10 points
- Code Quality: -5 points
- Efficiency: -0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: -5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: -3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a full score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 5 + 10 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 3 = 28
- Final Score: 100 - 28 = 72

### Final Score

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes system initialization, body creation, and visualization, which are all present in the reference script. However, it lacks some essential components:
     - **Missing Constraints**: The reference script uses additional constraints (e.g., `ChLinkNodeSlopeFrame`) that are not present in the provided code. This is a significant omission as it affects the behavior of the simulation.
     - **Missing Visual Shapes**: The reference script adds visual shapes to constraints (e.g., a visual shape for the hinge), which is absent in the provided code.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - Missing essential constraints: **15 points**
     - Missing visual shapes: **10 points**
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: **25 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code generally follows the correct usage of the PyChrono API, but there are some logical errors:
     - **Incorrect Force Application**: The force applied to the beam's front node in the provided code is significantly higher than in the reference script. This could lead to different simulation behavior.
     - **Inconsistent Body Properties**: The dimensions and properties of the box bodies are inconsistent with the reference script.
   - **Deductions**:
     - Incorrect force application: **10 points**
     - Logical errors in body properties: **10 points**
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: **20 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The provided code is relatively readable, but it lacks some comments that would help explain the purpose of certain sections, especially around the constraints and body creation.
   - **Deductions**:
     - Lack of meaningful comments: **5 points**
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not exhibit significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, there are some redundant calculations, such as repeatedly calling `builder.GetLastBeamNodes().back()` when it could be stored in a variable.
   - **Deductions**:
     - Minor inefficiencies: **3 points**
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **3 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms or checks for potential issues that could arise during the simulation.
   - **Deductions**:
     - Lack of basic error handling: **5 points**
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: **5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup in the provided code is mostly correct but lacks the additional visual shapes for constraints that are present in the reference script.
   - **Deductions**:
     - Missing visual shapes for constraints: **3 points**
   - **Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools**: **3 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: **25 points**
- Correctness: **20 points**
- Code Quality: **5 points**
- Efficiency: **3 points**
- Error Handling and Robustness: **5 points**
- Use of Visualization Tools: **3 points**

### Final Score Calculation
- Total Points Deducted: **61 points**
- Starting Score: **100 points**
- Final Score: **100 - 61 = 39**

### Final Score Output

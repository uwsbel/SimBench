### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

#### 1. Completeness (40 points total)
- **System Initialization**: The script initializes a `ChSystemSMC` but does not assign it to a variable, leading to multiple calls to create new systems. **(-15 points)**.
- **Body Creation**: The pendulum and fixed body are created, but the fixed body is not properly initialized with a mass or inertia. **(-10 points)**.
- **Visualization Setup**: The visualization is initialized but lacks essential setup steps such as attaching the system to the visualization and initializing the visualization system. **(-15 points)**.
- **Total Deductions**: **-40 points**.

#### 2. Correctness (30 points total)
- **Incorrect Use of API**: The script creates multiple instances of `ChSystemSMC` instead of using a single instance. This will lead to incorrect simulation behavior. **(-15 points)**.
- **Logical Errors**: The pendulum body is set with a force directly, which is not the standard way to apply forces in PyChrono. Forces should typically be applied in the simulation loop or through a motor joint. **(-10 points)**.
- **Total Deductions**: **-25 points**.

#### 3. Code Quality (10 points total)
- **Readability and Structure**: The code lacks meaningful comments and variable names, making it harder to understand. **(-5 points)**.
- **Insufficient Comments**: There are no comments explaining the purpose of each section or the parameters used. **(-5 points)**.
- **Total Deductions**: **-10 points**.

#### 4. Efficiency (10 points total)
- **Unnecessary Calculations**: The force is set directly on the pendulum body, which is not efficient for a dynamic simulation. Instead, it should be applied in a more structured manner. **(-5 points)**.
- **Total Deductions**: **-5 points**.

#### 5. Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)
- **Lack of Error Handling**: The script does not include any error handling or checks for the simulation state, which is important for robustness. **(-5 points)**.
- **Total Deductions**: **-5 points**.

#### 6. Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)
- **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The visualization is not properly initialized or configured, missing essential steps like setting window size, title, and adding lights. **(-5 points)**.
- **Total Deductions**: **-5 points**.

### Final Score Calculation
- **Total Deductions**: 
  - Completeness: -40
  - Correctness: -25
  - Code Quality: -10
  - Efficiency: -5
  - Error Handling: -5
  - Visualization: -5
- **Total Points Deducted**: 90 points
- **Final Score**: 100 - 90 = 10

### Final Score Output
[[10]] 

### Brief Explanation of Deductions
The script has significant issues with completeness, correctness, and overall structure. Key components are missing or incorrectly implemented, leading to a low score. The lack of comments and proper visualization setup further detracts from the quality of the code.

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **System Initialization**: The provided code initializes a `ChSystemSMC`, but it does not store it in a variable, which is a best practice for later reference. The reference uses `ChSystemNSC` and includes collision settings, which are missing in the provided code. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Ground Body**: The reference script includes a ground body with contact material, which is essential for realistic simulations. The provided code lacks this component. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The provided code initializes a visualization object but does not properly attach it to the system or configure it with a window size, title, or camera settings. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 15 + 15 + 10 = **40 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The provided code creates multiple instances of `ChSystemSMC()` instead of using a single instance. This can lead to confusion and incorrect simulation behavior. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Joint Initialization**: The revolute joint is initialized correctly, but the reference script uses a more complex setup with a fixed body and a specific frame. The provided code lacks the detail of the fixed body and proper initialization. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 15 + 10 = **25 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code lacks meaningful variable names and comments explaining the purpose of each section. The reference script is well-structured and documented. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Redundant Code**: The repeated creation of `ChSystemSMC()` is inefficient. The reference script avoids such redundancy by using a single system instance. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **5 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the simulation state, which could lead to issues during execution. The reference script includes more robust handling. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: **5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The provided code does not set up the visualization properly (e.g., missing camera settings, window title). The reference script includes comprehensive visualization setup. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: **5 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 40 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = **85 points**
- Final Score: 100 - 85 = **15 points**

### Final Score Output

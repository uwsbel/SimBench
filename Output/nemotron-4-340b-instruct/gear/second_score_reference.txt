### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code initializes the physical system, creates bodies, and sets up visualization, similar to the reference script. However, it is missing the call to `vis.Initialize()`, which is crucial for setting up the visualization window. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - The code also lacks the setting of the integrator type (`sys.SetTimestepperType(...)`), which is present in the reference script. This results in an additional deduction of **15 points**.
   - Total deductions for completeness: **30 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code incorrectly initializes the visualization camera and lacks the correct parameters for `vis.AddCamera(...)`. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - The rotation speed of the first gear is set correctly to 3 rad/s, but the code contains multiple comments about setting the rotation speed to various values, which is confusing and unnecessary. This results in a deduction of **5 points** for logical errors.
   - Total deductions for correctness: **15 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code lacks sufficient comments and documentation compared to the reference script, which affects readability. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - The structure is generally acceptable, but the presence of repeated comments regarding gear speeds detracts from clarity. This results in an additional deduction of **5 points**.
   - Total deductions for code quality: **10 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, the unnecessary repetition of comments regarding gear speeds could be seen as redundant. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - Total deductions for efficiency: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The code does not include any error handling or robustness checks, which are not explicitly present in the reference script either. However, the reference script does have a more structured approach to initialization. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - Total deductions for error handling and robustness: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is incomplete as it lacks the `vis.Initialize()` call and has incorrect parameters for the camera setup. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - Total deductions for visualization tools: **5 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: **30 points**
- Correctness: **15 points**
- Code Quality: **10 points**
- Efficiency: **5 points**
- Error Handling and Robustness: **5 points**
- Use of Visualization Tools: **5 points**

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total deductions: 30 + 15 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 5 = **70 points**
- Final score: 100 - 70 = **30 points**

### Final Score Output

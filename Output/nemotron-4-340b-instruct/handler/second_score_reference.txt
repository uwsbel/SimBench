### Evaluation of the Provided Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script, such as system initialization, body creation, and ROS communication setup. Therefore, there are no deductions in this category.
   - **Score: 40/40**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code has a significant issue in the `Tick` method of the `MyCustomHandler` class. The reference script publishes integer messages, while the provided code publishes string messages. This is a significant deviation that could affect the simulation's intended behavior.
   - **Deduction: 15 points**
   - There are no other logical errors or incorrect API usages that would warrant further deductions.
   - **Score: 15/30**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names and adequate comments. However, the comments could be slightly more detailed in some areas, particularly in the `Tick` method.
   - **Deduction: 5 points for insufficient comments.**
   - **Score: 5/10**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code compared to the reference script. There are no obvious optimization opportunities missed.
   - **Score: 10/10**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks any explicit error handling mechanisms. The reference script handles potential issues with ROS communication more robustly.
   - **Deduction: 5 points for lack of basic error handling.**
   - **Score: 0/5**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any visualization setup, which is present in the reference script. This is a significant omission.
   - **Deduction: 5 points for inadequate visualization setup.**
   - **Score: 0/5**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points deducted
- Correctness: 15 points deducted (incorrect message type)
- Code Quality: 5 points deducted (insufficient comments)
- Efficiency: 0 points deducted
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points deducted (lack of error handling)
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points deducted (no visualization setup)

### Final Score Calculation
Total score = 40 + 15 + 5 + 10 + 0 + 0 = 70

### Final Score

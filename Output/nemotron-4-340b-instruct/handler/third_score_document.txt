   - **Basic Error Handling**: The code lacks explicit error handling for potential issues, such as ROS initialization failures or simulation step failures. **(5 points deducted)**
   - **Edge Cases**: There is no handling for edge cases, such as what happens if the simulation time exceeds `time_end`. **(0 points deducted)**

   **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is adequate, with proper lighting and camera configuration. **(0 points deducted)**
   - **Minor Issues**: There are no minor visualization issues noted. **(0 points deducted)**

   **Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools: 0 points**

### Final Score Calculation
- Total Points: 100
- Deductions: 5 points (for error handling)
- Final Score: 100 - 5 = 95

### Final Score Output
[[95]] 

### Explanation of Deductions
The script is well-structured and follows best practices for PyChrono simulations. The only deduction was for the lack of basic error handling, which is important for robustness in simulations. Overall, the script is complete, correct, and efficient.

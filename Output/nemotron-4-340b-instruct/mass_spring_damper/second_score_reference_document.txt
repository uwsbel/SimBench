### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. However, there are minor deviations in the naming conventions and some comments that could be clearer.
   - **Deductions**: **5 points** for minor omissions or slight deviations from the reference script.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The custom force functor `MySpringForce` is implemented correctly, but the `Evaluate` method does not match the reference in terms of parameters and functionality. The reference uses a simpler approach for force calculation, which is more efficient and aligns better with the intended use of the `ChLinkTSDA`.
   - **Deductions**: **15 points** for incorrect use of the PyChrono API that could lead to a significant change in simulation behavior.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally readable and well-structured, but it lacks some comments that would help clarify the purpose of certain sections, particularly around the custom force functor.
   - **Deductions**: **5 points** for insufficient comments or failure to follow documentation best practices.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code contains unnecessary calculations in the `Evaluate` method of the `MySpringForce` class, which could be simplified. The reference script uses a more efficient approach to calculate the spring force.
   - **Deductions**: **5 points** for unnecessary calculations.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms or checks for potential issues, such as ensuring that the positions of bodies are valid before simulation.
   - **Deductions**: **5 points** for lack of basic error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor issues with the color settings for the visual shapes that could be improved for better clarity.
   - **Deductions**: **2 points** for minor visualization issues.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: -5 points
- Correctness: -15 points
- Code Quality: -5 points
- Efficiency: -5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: -5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: -2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 5 + 15 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 2 = 37 points
- Final Score: 100 - 37 = 63

Thus, the final score for the provided PyChrono code is: 

[[63]]

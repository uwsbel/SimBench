### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code is missing the creation of `body_2` and `body_3` at the correct positions. In the reference script, `body_2` is positioned at `(-1, -6, 0)` and `body_3` at `(-1, -9, 0)`, while in the provided code, they are positioned at `(0, -3, 0)` and `(1, -3, 0)`, respectively. This is a significant deviation.
   - **Deductions**: 15 points for each body missing or incorrectly positioned (2 bodies) = **30 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The initialization of springs in the provided code is incorrect. The reference script initializes `spring_2` and `spring_3` with the correct bodies and positions, while the provided code does not match this logic. Specifically, `spring_2` should connect `body_1` to `body_2` and `spring_3` should connect `body_2` to `body_3`, but the provided code has incorrect initialization.
   - **Deductions**: 15 points for incorrect use of the PyChrono API in spring initialization (2 springs) = **30 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks comments that explain the purpose of each section or component, which are present in the reference script. This affects readability and understanding.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments and 5 points for poor readability due to lack of structure = **10 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not have any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script, but it does not utilize the same level of optimization in terms of body positioning and spring connections.
   - **Deductions**: 3 points for missing obvious optimization opportunities = **3 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks that could enhance robustness, which is not explicitly handled in the reference script either, but the reference script is more structured.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of basic error handling = **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup in the provided code is mostly correct, but it lacks the clarity and completeness of the reference script, particularly in the naming and organization of the visualization elements.
   - **Deductions**: 3 points for inadequate visualization setup = **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 30 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Total points deducted: 30 + 30 + 10 + 3 + 5 + 3 = **81 points**.

Starting from a total of 100 points, the final score is:
100 - 81 = **19 points**.

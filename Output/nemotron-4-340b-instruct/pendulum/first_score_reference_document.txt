### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **System Initialization**: The provided code initializes the `ChSystemSMC`, while the reference uses `ChSystemNSC`. This is a significant difference as it affects the simulation's behavior. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Ground Body Creation**: The ground body is created as a box in the provided code, while the reference uses a fixed body without collision. The provided code does not disable collision for the ground, which is a detail present in the reference. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The provided code lacks additional visualization features such as adding a logo, skybox, and camera settings, which are present in the reference. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 + 10 + 15 = **40 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The use of `ChSystemSMC` instead of `ChSystemNSC` could lead to different simulation results. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Joint Initialization**: The initialization of the revolute joint is done correctly, but the reference uses a different frame for initialization which is more appropriate for the pendulum setup. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 + 10 = **25 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code is relatively readable, but it lacks comments explaining the purpose of each section, which is a strength of the reference code. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The provided code calculates the inertia tensor manually, which is not necessary when using `ChBodyEasySphere`. The reference code uses a simpler approach. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the simulation state, which is present in the reference. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The provided code does not include advanced visualization features like adding a logo, skybox, or camera settings, which are present in the reference. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
The total deductions amount to **85 points** from a maximum of **100 points**, resulting in a final score of **15 points**.

### Final Score

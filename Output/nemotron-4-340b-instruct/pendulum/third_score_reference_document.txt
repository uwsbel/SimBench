### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: 
     - The reference script uses `sys.AddBody(pend_1)` and `sys.AddBody(pend_2)` to add the pendulum bodies, while the provided script uses `sys.Add(pend_1)` and `sys.Add(pend_2)`. This is a minor deviation but does not warrant a deduction.
     - The height of the visualization cylinders for the pendulums is set to 2 in the reference script, while the provided script sets it to 1. This is a significant difference as it affects the visual representation of the pendulums.
     - The position of the second pendulum is set to `(3, 0, 1)` in the reference script, while it is set to `(2, 0, 1)` in the provided script. This affects the simulation's configuration.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - 10 points for the incorrect height of the pendulum visualization shapes.
     - 10 points for the incorrect position of the second pendulum.
   - **Total Deductions**: 20 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of PyChrono API**: 
     - The provided script initializes the revolute joint for the second pendulum incorrectly by using the wrong frame position `(0, 0, 1)` instead of `(2, 0, 1)` as in the reference script. This will significantly change the behavior of the simulation.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - 15 points for the incorrect initialization of the revolute joint.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided script is generally well-structured and readable. However, it lacks some comments that could clarify the purpose of certain sections, especially around joint initialization and visualization.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - 5 points for insufficient comments.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The provided script uses a time step of `1e-3` in `sys.DoStepDynamics`, while the reference script uses `1e-2`. This is a significant difference that could lead to inefficiencies in the simulation.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - 5 points for using a smaller time step than necessary.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided script does not include any error handling mechanisms or checks for the simulation state, which could lead to issues during execution.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - 5 points for lack of basic error handling.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The provided script sets up the visualization correctly but does not include the same level of detail in the lighting setup as the reference script.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - 3 points for minor visualization issues.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 20 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 53 points
- Final Score: 100 - 53 = 47

### Final Score

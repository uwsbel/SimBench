### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: The provided code creates two vehicles, but the reference script initializes the second vehicle differently by passing the system directly to the constructor. This is a significant difference in how the vehicles are instantiated. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Minor Omissions**: The reference script uses a single driver system for both vehicles, while the provided code creates separate driver systems for each vehicle. This is not necessarily a missing component but a deviation from the reference approach. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 20 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The provided code uses `driver1.GetInputs()` and `driver2.GetInputs()` but does not utilize the driver inputs correctly for the second vehicle, which could lead to unintended behavior. The reference script sets the steering and throttle directly on the driver objects. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors**: The sinusoidal steering input is applied equally to both vehicles, which may not be the intended behavior. The reference script differentiates the steering inputs for each vehicle. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured, but the variable names for the second vehicle (`vehicle2`) could be more descriptive. The comments are adequate but could be improved for clarity. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The code has redundant calls to `driver_inputs1` and `driver_inputs2` that could be optimized by using a single driver object for both vehicles. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The script does not include any error handling mechanisms, such as checking if the vehicles are initialized correctly or if the visualization system is running properly. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor differences in how the vehicles are attached to the visualization system compared to the reference script. **(Deduct 3 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 20 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 20 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 63 points
- Final Score: 100 - 63 = 37 points

### Final Score

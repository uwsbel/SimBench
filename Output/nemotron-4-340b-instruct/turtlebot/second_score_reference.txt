### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code contains all essential components present in the reference script, including system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. Therefore, no points are deducted in this category.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The movement logic in the provided code differs from the reference script. Specifically, the speeds for the motors are set differently, which could lead to a significant change in the robot's behavior. The reference script uses negative speeds for both wheels when moving straight, while the provided code uses positive speeds.
   - Additionally, the provided code does not print the movement mode in the same way as the reference script, which could be considered a logical error in terms of user feedback.
   - **Score: 15 points deducted for incorrect use of motor speeds.**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The provided code is generally well-structured and readable. However, it lacks some comments that could enhance understanding, particularly in the movement function. The reference script provides more context in its comments.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted for insufficient comments.**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not exhibit any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, it could be argued that the movement function could be optimized by avoiding repeated calls to `robot.SetMotorSpeed` for the same wheel in the same mode.
   - **Score: 3 points deducted for missing optimization opportunities.**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code has basic error handling for invalid movement modes, similar to the reference script. There are no significant issues in this area.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup in the provided code is mostly correct and matches the reference script. However, the provided code does not include the print statements for the movement modes, which could be considered a minor visualization issue in terms of user feedback.
   - **Score: 2 points deducted for minor visualization issues.**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 0 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Total deductions: 15 + 5 + 3 + 2 = 25 points

Total possible score: 100
Final score: 100 - 25 = 75

### Final Score Output
[[75]]

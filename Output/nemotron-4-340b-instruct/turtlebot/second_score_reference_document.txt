### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided script includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. Therefore, no points are deducted here.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The movement control logic in the provided script has a significant difference compared to the reference script. The speeds set for the wheels in the `move` function are not consistent with the reference. For example, the reference sets both wheels to `-math.pi` for straight movement, while the provided script sets them to `math.pi / 2`, which could lead to different behavior.
   - **Score: 15 points deducted for incorrect use of the PyChrono API that could lead to a significant change in simulation behavior.**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The provided script is generally well-structured and readable. However, it lacks some comments that could enhance understanding, particularly in the `move` function. The reference script provides better documentation in this aspect.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted for insufficient comments.**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided script is efficient and does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows the same structure as the reference script without any apparent inefficiencies.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided script raises a `ValueError` for invalid movement modes, similar to the reference script. There are no significant issues in error handling compared to the reference.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup in the provided script is consistent with the reference script, including the addition of lights and camera settings. However, the reference script uses a slightly different approach for motor speed settings, which could affect the visual representation of the robot's movement.
   - **Score: 2 points deducted for minor visualization issues.**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 0 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Total points deducted: 15 + 5 + 2 = 22 points

Starting from a total of 100 points:
100 - 22 = 78 points

### Final Score
[[78]]

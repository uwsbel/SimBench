### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks the initialization of the collision system type, which is present in the reference script. This is crucial for proper physics simulation. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - The ground body in the reference script uses a contact material (`ChContactMaterialNSC`), which is not defined in the provided code. This omission can affect the simulation's accuracy. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - The reference script includes a texture for the ground visualization, which is absent in the provided code. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 35 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: 
     - The provided code uses `chrono.ChSystemSMC()` while the reference uses `chrono.ChSystemNSC()`. This could lead to significant differences in simulation behavior. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The provided code does not correctly set the gravitational acceleration in the same manner as the reference script, which could lead to inconsistencies in simulation results. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The provided code is reasonably structured but lacks comments explaining the purpose of various sections, which reduces readability. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The provided code has redundant calls to set the tire contact callback for each tire individually, which could be optimized by using a loop. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms or checks for successful initialization of components, which are present in the reference script. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code lacks some visual enhancements such as adding a logo or a skybox, which are included in the reference script. **(Deduct 3 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 35 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 35 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 78 points
- Final Score: 100 - 78 = 22 points

### Final Score Output

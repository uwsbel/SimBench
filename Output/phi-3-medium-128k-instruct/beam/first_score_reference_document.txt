### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks the creation of a mesh (`ChMesh`) and the use of a section object for beam properties (`ChBeamSectionEulerAdvanced`), which are essential for defining the beam's characteristics. This results in a deduction of **15 points** for each missing essential component.
     - The reference code includes constraints and forces applied to nodes, which are missing in the provided code. This results in an additional deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The provided code uses `ChBeamRodNSC`, which is not the same as `ChElementBeamEuler` used in the reference. This could lead to significant differences in simulation behavior. Deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The provided code does not correctly set up nodes and elements as in the reference code, which could lead to incorrect simulation results. Deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The provided code lacks meaningful comments and documentation compared to the reference code, which is well-structured and documented. Deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The provided code does not optimize the visualization setup and simulation loop as effectively as the reference code. Deduction of **5 points** for not using efficient visualization methods.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for common issues, which the reference code does. Deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code does not set up the visualization tools as comprehensively as the reference code. Deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
- Starting Score: 100 points
- Total Deductions: 75 points
- Final Score: 100 - 75 = 25 points

### Final Score Output
[[25]]

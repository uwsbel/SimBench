### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks several essential components that are present in the reference script:
     - **System Initialization**: The reference script initializes a `ChSystemSMC`, while the provided code incorrectly uses `ChLinkCreateStatic`, which is not a system initialization. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - **Body Creation**: The reference script creates multiple bodies and links them, while the provided code only creates a single beam and a static link. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - **Visualization Setup**: The reference script includes detailed visualization setup, including camera, lights, and skybox, which are missing in the provided code. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 15 + 15 + 15 = **45 points** (but capped at 40 points).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The provided code uses `ChLinkCreateStatic` instead of initializing a `ChSystem`, which fundamentally alters the simulation behavior. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors**: The motor function is added incorrectly; the reference uses a motor link that is initialized properly. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 15 + 10 = **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code lacks meaningful comments and has poor structure compared to the reference script, which is well-documented and organized. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The provided code has redundant calculations and lacks optimizations present in the reference script, such as using a proper solver and timestepper. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not account for potential errors or edge cases, such as checking for successful initialization of components. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The provided code does not set up visualization properly, missing elements like camera and lighting. **(Deduct 5 points)**.
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: **5 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a total of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 40 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = **85 points**.

Final Score: **100 - 85 = 15 points**.

### Final Score Output
[[15]]

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks several components that are present in the reference script:
     - The reference script includes additional constraints and visualizations for the beams and nodes, which are entirely missing in the provided code. This results in a deduction of **15 points** for each missing essential component.
     - The reference script also includes a more comprehensive setup for the visualization system, including lighting and camera settings, which are absent in the provided code. This results in an additional deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points (2 components missing).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The provided code uses `ChLinkMotorRotationSpeed` instead of `ChLinkMotorRotationAngle`, which is a significant deviation that could lead to different simulation behavior. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: The parameters for the beam section and the number of elements in the `BuildBeam` function differ from the reference script, which could lead to incorrect simulation results. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points (1 incorrect API usage, 1 logical error).

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured, but it lacks some clarity in variable naming and organization compared to the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Comments**: The provided code has fewer comments explaining the purpose of various sections compared to the reference script, which is better documented. This results in an additional deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 10 points (5 for readability, 5 for comments).

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The provided code does not utilize the `vd` vector effectively, and the calculations for positions could be optimized. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points (1 instance of unnecessary calculations).

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for potential issues, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points (lack of error handling).

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The provided code does not set up the visualization system as comprehensively as the reference script, lacking elements like lighting, camera settings, and additional visual shapes. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points (inadequate visualization setup).

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 25 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 80 points
- Final Score: 100 - 80 = 20 points

### Final Score Output

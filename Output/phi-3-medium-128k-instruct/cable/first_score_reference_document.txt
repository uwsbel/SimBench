### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: 
     - The provided code does not include the creation of a mesh or the use of `ChBuilderCableANCF`, which is a crucial part of setting up an ANCF beam simulation. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
     - The visualization setup is less comprehensive than in the reference script, which includes detailed visual shapes for the beam and nodes. This results in an additional deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The `RevoluteJoint` is incorrectly initialized; it should be a `ChLinkLockRevolute` instead. This leads to a deduction of **15 points**.
     - The `AddRigidBody` method is not a standard method for adding a beam to the system. Instead, the beam should be added to the mesh and then the mesh to the system. This results in another deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code lacks meaningful comments and structure compared to the reference script. The variable names are not as descriptive, and the overall readability is lower. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The visualization callback is inefficient as it prints positions for each node every step, which is unnecessary for the simulation and can slow down performance. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, such as checking if the system or visualization is initialized correctly. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is minimal compared to the reference script, which includes additional visual elements and better lighting. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 30 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 25 + 30 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 73 points
- Final Score: 100 - 73 = 27 points

### Final Score Output

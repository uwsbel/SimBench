### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

#### Completeness (40 points total)
- **System Initialization**: The script correctly initializes the `ChSystemNSC` and sets gravitational acceleration, which is essential. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Body Creation**: Both bodies (`body_1` and `body_2`) are created and configured properly. The ground body is also created and fixed. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Visualization Setup**: The visualization system is set up correctly with a window size, title, logo, skybox, camera, and lights. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Spring Creation**: Two springs are created and initialized correctly, with one using a custom force functor. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Comments and Documentation**: The code lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of each section and the parameters used. **(10 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Completeness: 10 points**

#### Correctness (30 points total)
- **API Usage**: The script uses the PyChrono API correctly for creating bodies, springs, and visualization. However, the `ComputeForces` method in `MySpringForce` incorrectly accesses `info.wRigidBody->GetForce()` using C++ style syntax instead of Python syntax. This could lead to runtime errors. **(15 points deducted)**
- **Logical Errors**: The initialization of the spring and bodies appears correct, with appropriate parameters set. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Minor Inaccuracies**: The use of `chrono.ChVector3D()` should be `chrono.ChVector3d()` for consistency with the API. **(5 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Correctness: 20 points**

#### Code Quality (10 points total)
- **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured, but the lack of comments and inconsistent naming conventions (e.g., `sph_1`, `sph_2`) detracts from readability. **(5 points deducted)**
- **Comments**: There are insufficient comments to explain the purpose of various sections and parameters. **(5 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Code Quality: 10 points**

#### Efficiency (10 points total)
- **Unnecessary Calculations**: The code does not contain any obvious inefficiencies or redundant calculations. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Optimization Opportunities**: There are no significant optimization opportunities missed. **(0 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Efficiency: 0 points**

#### Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)
- **Error Handling**: The script lacks any error handling mechanisms, which could lead to issues during runtime if unexpected conditions occur. **(5 points deducted)**
- **Edge Cases**: There is no consideration for edge cases, such as what happens if the bodies are not initialized correctly. **(0 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points**

#### Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)
- **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the lighting could be improved for better visibility. **(3 points deducted)**
- **Minor Issues**: There are no significant issues with the visualization elements. **(0 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points**

### Final Score Calculation
- **Total Points Deducted**: 10 (Completeness) + 20 (Correctness) + 10 (Code Quality) + 0 (Efficiency) + 5 (Error Handling) + 3 (Visualization) = 48 points deducted
- **Final Score**: 100 - 48 = 52

### Final Score Output
[[52]] 

### Summary of Deductions
- **Completeness**: 10 points for insufficient comments.
- **Correctness**: 20 points for incorrect API usage and minor inaccuracies.
- **Code Quality**: 10 points for lack of comments and inconsistent naming.
- **Error Handling**: 5 points for lack of error handling.
- **Use of Visualization Tools**: 3 points for minor visualization issues. 

Overall, the script demonstrates a good understanding of the PyChrono API but requires improvements in comments, error handling, and minor corrections in syntax for better performance and clarity.

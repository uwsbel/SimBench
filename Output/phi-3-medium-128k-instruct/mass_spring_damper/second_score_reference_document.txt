### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. However, there are minor deviations in the visualization setup (e.g., the color of `box_2` is different from the reference). 
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for minor deviations in visualization details.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The custom force functor `MySpringForce` in the provided code does not correctly implement the `evaluate` method as per the reference. Instead, it uses `ComputeForces`, which is not the correct method for the intended functionality. This could lead to significant changes in simulation behavior.
   - **Deductions**: 15 points for incorrect use of the PyChrono API in the custom force functor.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable. However, it lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of certain sections, particularly in the custom force functor.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not exhibit any unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows the reference script closely in terms of efficiency.
   - **Deductions**: 0 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which could be important for robustness, especially in a simulation context.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of basic error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the color of `box_2` differs from the reference, which could affect the visual clarity of the simulation.
   - **Deductions**: 3 points for minor visualization issues.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total deductions: 5 + 15 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 3 = 33 points
- Final score: 100 - 33 = 67

### Final Score

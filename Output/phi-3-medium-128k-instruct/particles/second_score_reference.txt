### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. However, it lacks the call to `body.EmptyAccumulators()` before calculating kinetic energy, which is present in the reference script. This omission is significant as it can lead to incorrect energy calculations.
   - **Deductions**: 15 points for missing essential component (EmptyAccumulators call).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code incorrectly calculates kinetic energy using `body.GetLinearVelocity()` instead of `body.GetPosDt()`, which is the correct method to obtain the velocity for kinetic energy calculations. This is a significant error that affects simulation behavior.
   - The gravitational constant `G_constant` is defined after its first use in the potential energy calculation, which could lead to confusion or errors in understanding the flow of the code.
   - **Deductions**: 15 points for incorrect use of PyChrono API (kinetic energy calculation).

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable. However, there are minor issues with variable naming and formatting that could be improved for clarity. The comments are present but could be more descriptive, especially regarding the purpose of certain calculations.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for minor readability and documentation issues.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code performs unnecessary calculations by calculating potential energy before the force accumulation loop. The reference script calculates potential energy in a more efficient manner. 
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for unnecessary calculations.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks any error handling or checks for edge cases, such as division by zero when calculating forces. The reference script does not explicitly handle these cases either, but it is generally more robust in its structure.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of basic error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor issues such as the absence of a call to `body.EmptyAccumulators()` which could affect visual representation of the simulation.
   - **Deductions**: 3 points for minor visualization issues.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 15 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a full score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 48 points
- Final Score: 100 - 48 = 52

### Final Score Output

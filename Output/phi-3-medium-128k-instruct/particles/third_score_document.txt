### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

#### Completeness (40 points total)
- **System Initialization**: The script correctly initializes the `ChSystemNSC` and sets the collision system type. No points deducted.
- **Body Creation**: The script creates a sphere body and adds it to the system. It also creates additional spheres later in the simulation. No points deducted.
- **Visualization Setup**: The visualization system is properly initialized and configured. No points deducted.
- **Essential Components**: The script includes an emitter and particle properties, which are essential for the simulation. No points deducted.
- **Missing Components**: The script does not include any error handling or checks for the success of operations (e.g., checking if the emitter is properly initialized). Deduct **10 points** for this omission.

**Total Completeness Points: 30/40**

#### Correctness (30 points total)
- **API Usage**: The script uses the PyChrono API correctly in most parts. However, the gravitational constant is modified without a clear justification, which could lead to confusion. Deduct **5 points** for this minor inaccuracy.
- **Logical Errors**: The calculation of potential energy assumes that all bodies interact with each other, which may not be the case if they are too far apart. This could lead to incorrect results in certain scenarios. Deduct **10 points** for this logical error.
- **Minor Inaccuracies**: The use of `body.EmptyAccumulators()` is unnecessary since it is not required after each simulation step. Deduct **5 points** for this minor inefficiency.

**Total Correctness Points: 10/30**

#### Code Quality (10 points total)
- **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. No points deducted.
- **Comments**: The script lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of various sections and calculations. Deduct **5 points** for insufficient comments.

**Total Code Quality Points: 5/10**

#### Efficiency (10 points total)
- **Unnecessary Calculations**: The script calculates forces and energies in a way that could be optimized. For example, the potential energy calculation could be simplified or avoided if not needed for the simulation. Deduct **5 points** for unnecessary calculations.
- **Optimization Opportunities**: There are some opportunities to optimize the particle emission process and force calculations, but they are not critical. Deduct **3 points** for missing these optimizations.

**Total Efficiency Points: 2/10**

#### Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)
- **Error Handling**: The script lacks basic error handling, such as checking if the emitter is properly initialized or if the bodies are added successfully. Deduct **5 points** for this lack of robustness.

**Total Error Handling Points: 0/5**

#### Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)
- **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the lighting could be improved for better visibility. Deduct **3 points** for inadequate lighting setup.
- **Minor Visualization Issues**: There are no significant issues with the visualization elements. No points deducted.

**Total Visualization Points: 2/5**

### Final Score Calculation
- Completeness: 30/40
- Correctness: 10/30
- Code Quality: 5/10
- Efficiency: 2/10
- Error Handling: 0/5
- Visualization: 2/5

**Total Score: 49/100**

### Final Score Output

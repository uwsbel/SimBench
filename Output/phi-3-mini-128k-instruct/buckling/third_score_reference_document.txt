### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks several components present in the reference script:
     - The solver initialization (`chrono.ChSolverPardisoMKL()`) is missing.
     - The timestepper setup (`chrono.ChTimestepperHHT()`) is also absent.
     - The visualization setup is incomplete (e.g., missing camera setup, lighting, and logo).
     - The reference script includes additional constraints and visual shapes that are not present in the provided code.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - Missing solver and timestepper: **15 points** each (total: 30 points).
     - Incomplete visualization setup: **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **40 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The provided code uses `chrono.ChLinkMotorRotationSpeed()` instead of `chrono.ChLinkMotorRotationAngle()`, which is a significant change in simulation behavior.
   - **Logical Errors**: The motor function is incorrectly set (`SetTorqueFunction` instead of `SetAngleFunction`).
   - **Deductions**: 
     - Incorrect API usage: **15 points**.
     - Logical errors in motor initialization: **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code is somewhat readable, but the structure is less organized compared to the reference script. There are also sections of code that are incomplete or contain extraneous characters, which detracts from clarity.
   - **Comments**: While there are comments, they are not as detailed or informative as those in the reference script.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - Poor readability and structure: **5 points**.
     - Insufficient comments: **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **10 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The provided code does not seem to have significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script, but it lacks optimizations present in the reference.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - Missing optimizations: **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **3 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are important for robustness.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - Lack of basic error handling: **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is incomplete compared to the reference script, lacking essential elements like camera positioning and lighting.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - Inadequate visualization setup: **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: **40 points**
- Correctness: **25 points**
- Code Quality: **10 points**
- Efficiency: **3 points**
- Error Handling: **5 points**
- Visualization: **5 points**

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a total of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 40 + 25 + 10 + 3 + 5 + 5 = **88 points**
- Final Score: **100 - 88 = 12 points**

### Final Score Output

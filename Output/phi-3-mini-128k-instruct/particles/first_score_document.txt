### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **System Initialization**: The script uses `chrono.ChSystemContext()` instead of `chrono.ChSystemNSC()` or `chrono.ChSystemSMC()`, which are the recommended ways to initialize a simulation system. This is a significant omission. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Particle Emitter Configuration**: The particle emitter is created, but there is no mention of adding it to the system in a way that integrates with the simulation loop. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is incomplete. The `ChVisualScene` is created, but it lacks initialization and proper attachment to the system. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Main Loop**: The main loop is present, but it lacks proper simulation step execution (`sys.DoStepDynamics(time_step)`), which is critical for running the simulation. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 50 points (15 + 10 + 10 + 15)

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: The use of `chrono.ChSystemContext()` is incorrect for initializing the simulation system. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors**: The custom gravitational force function does not correctly apply forces based on distance; it should calculate the gravitational force based on mass and distance. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 25 points (15 + 10)

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally readable, but the lack of comments explaining the purpose of functions and sections detracts from its quality. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The gravitational force calculation in the `custom_gravitational_force` function is inefficient as it calculates the distance vector multiple times. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The script does not include any error handling mechanisms, such as checking if the system or particles are properly initialized before use. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is incomplete and lacks essential elements like camera setup and lighting. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
- **Total Points Deducted**: 50 (Completeness) + 25 (Correctness) + 5 (Code Quality) + 5 (Efficiency) + 5 (Error Handling) + 5 (Visualization) = 95 points deducted.
- **Final Score**: 100 - 95 = 5 points.

### Final Score Output
[[5]] 

### Explanation of Deductions
The script has significant issues with completeness, correctness, and robustness. Key components for system initialization, simulation execution, and visualization setup are either missing or incorrectly implemented. The gravitational force calculation is also flawed, leading to logical errors in the simulation. Overall, the code lacks sufficient comments and error handling, which further detracts from its quality.

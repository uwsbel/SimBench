### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks the initialization of the simulation system (`ChSystemNSC` or similar), which is essential for any PyChrono simulation. This results in a **15-point deduction**.
     - The reference script includes visual shapes for both the ground and the pendulum, which are missing in the provided code. This results in another **15-point deduction**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The provided code uses `pc.Body` and `pc.Joint`, which do not match the expected API usage in the reference script (which uses `chrono.ChBody` and `chrono.ChLinkLockRevolute`). This could lead to significant differences in simulation behavior, resulting in a **15-point deduction**.
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The pendulum's inertia is set incorrectly as `pc.Inertia(mass * length**2 / 3)`, which does not match the reference's inertia tensor setup. This results in a **10-point deduction**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The code lacks meaningful comments and documentation compared to the reference script, which provides detailed explanations for each component. This results in a **5-point deduction**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The simulation loop prints the pendulum position and velocity every 100 iterations, which is less efficient than the reference script's logging after a specific time. This results in a **5-point deduction**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for simulation conditions, which the reference script implicitly handles. This results in a **5-point deduction**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code does not set up the visualization as comprehensively as the reference script, which includes additional visual elements like a skybox and camera settings. This results in a **5-point deduction**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
The total deductions amount to **75 points** from a maximum of **100 points**, resulting in a final score of **25 points**.

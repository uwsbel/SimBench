### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code lacks the initialization of the vehicle using the `HMMWV_Full()` or `HMMWV_Reduced()` methods, which is essential for creating a vehicle in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
     - The terrain initialization is not as detailed as in the reference script, which specifies parameters for soil properties and texture. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage (15 points each)**: 
     - The use of `chrono.ChSystemSys` is incorrect; it should be `chrono.ChSystem` for system initialization. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors (10 points)**: 
     - The vehicle's mass and inertia settings are arbitrary and do not match the reference script's initialization. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 to 10 points)**: 
     - The code lacks meaningful comments and documentation, making it less readable compared to the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations (5 points)**: 
     - The simulation loop does not effectively manage the rendering and simulation steps as in the reference script, leading to potential inefficiencies. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for common issues, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 to 5 points)**: 
     - The visualization setup is less comprehensive than in the reference script, lacking features like a chase camera and proper lighting. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 70 points
- Final Score: 100 - 70 = 30 points

### Final Score Output

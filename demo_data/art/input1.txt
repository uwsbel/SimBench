Create a PyChrono simulation of an ARTcar vehicle on a rigid terrain using Irrlicht for visualization. Initialize the vehicle with specific parameters such as location, orientation, contact method, and visualization type. Set up a RigidTerrain with defined dimensions, add a custom texture, and incorporate an interactive driver system to control the vehicleâ€™s steering, throttle, and braking. Implement a simulation loop that updates the vehicle dynamics and visualization in real time, displaying the simulation at 50 frames per second.

Develop a PyChrono simulation involving a beam buckling scenario. Incorporate finite element analysis (FEA) for the beam elements, define custom motor functions, and include constraints between different parts of the system. Visualize the simulation using the Irrlicht visualization module and ensure that a suitable solver and timestepper are implemented for accurate dynamics simulation."

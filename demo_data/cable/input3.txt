Based on the given input code, please modify it to include the following changes:

1. **Model Update**:
   - Instead of creating a single beam, modify the code to generate multiple chains of beam elements with connected bodies.
   - Create a new parameter in the `Model1` class to specify the number of chains (`n_chains`) with a default value of 6.
   - In the `Model1.__init__` method, utilize this `n_chains` parameter to loop and generate the specified number of chains.

2. **Multiple Chains Generation**:
   - For each chain:
     - Create and initialize a truss body as a fixed reference frame (`mtruss`).
     - Use an appropriate number of ANCF cable elements along the beam, increasing with each chain.
     - Set relative positions for starting and ending points of each beam to avoid overlap.
     - Apply boundary conditions and loads including hinge constraints and forces.
     - Connect each beam's endpoint to a chrono body (box) and establish further constraints between the beam endpoint and the box.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Ensure to add visualization objects for the newly created elements and chains similar to the input code.

4. **New Functions**:
   - Implement a `PrintBodyPositions` function within `Model1` that prints the positions of the end bodies of each chain at each step of the simulation.

Make sure these modifications are correctly implemented in the code and verify the simulation for accuracy and smooth dynamics. Don't forget to test the `PrintBodyPositions` function to ensure it accurately prints the positions of the end bodies in each chain during the simulation.

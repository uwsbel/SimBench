Create a PyChrono simulation where a triangular mesh (loaded from a Wavefront .obj file) is visualized as a fixed body in the scene. Add a camera sensor to the body, managed by a sensor manager, with noise filters and visualizations applied to the camera images. Simulate the system, dynamically updating the camera's position in an orbit around the mesh, and print out camera buffer data at each step.

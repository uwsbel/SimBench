Simulate a CityBus vehicle on a rigid terrain using PyChrono and Irrlicht for visualization. Initialize the vehicle with parameters including location, orientation, and tire model. Use a combination of mesh and primitive visualization types for different vehicle parts and set the camera to follow the vehicle from a specified position. Implement a RigidTerrain with a custom texture and create an interactive driver system that allows for control of the vehicleâ€™s steering, throttle, and braking. The simulation loop should run at 50 frames per second, updating the vehicle dynamics and rendering the scene in real time.

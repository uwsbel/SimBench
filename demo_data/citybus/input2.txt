1.	Driver System Modification:
	    Replace the interactive driver system (veh.ChInteractiveDriverIRR) with a data-driven driver system (veh.ChDataDriver).
	    Define a sequence of driver inputs using veh.vector_Entry and veh.DataDriverEntry. This sequence should include the following entries:
	    At time 0.0 seconds, set throttle to 0.0, steering to 0.0, and braking to 0.0.
	    At time 0.1 seconds, set throttle to 1.0, steering to 0.0, and braking to 0.0.
	    At time 0.5 seconds, set throttle to 1.0, steering to 0.7, and braking to 0.0.
2.	Remove Time Response Settings:
	    Remove the code section that sets the time response for steering, throttle, and braking inputs, as these are not applicable to the data-driven driver system.

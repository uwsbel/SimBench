Create a PyChrono simulation showcasing a Curiosity rover navigating on a rigid terrain. The system includes a fixed ground with collision properties and a rover model equipped with a motor control driver for real-time steering inputs. Visualize the simulation using the Irrlicht visualization system with customizable camera settings, lighting, shadows, and additional visual elements like textures and logos.

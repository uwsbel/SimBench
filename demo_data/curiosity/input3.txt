1. Added the sensor module (`pychrono.sensor`) import.
2. Created a sensor manager (`sens.ChSensorManager(system)`).
3. Added a lidar sensor to the rover:
   - Defined lidar parameters such as update rate, horizontal and vertical samples, field of view, etc.
   - Created the lidar sensor (`sens.ChLidarSensor`) and attached it to the rover's chassis.
   - Set up filters for the lidar data.
   - Added the lidar sensor to the sensor manager.
4. Included updating the sensor manager in the simulation loop (`manager.Update()`).

Create a PyChrono simulation of a FEDA vehicle on a rigid terrain using Irrlicht for visualization. Initialize the vehicle with specific parameters such as location, orientation, contact method, and tire model. Set the camera to follow the vehicle from a designated position, and implement a RigidTerrain with a custom texture. Use a mesh visualization type for all vehicle parts and integrate an interactive driver system to control the vehicleâ€™s steering, throttle, and braking. The simulation loop should run at 50 frames per second, updating the vehicle dynamics and rendering the scene in real time.

1.	Driver System Modification:
	    Replace the interactive driver system with a path-follower, cruise-control driver system.
	    Create a path that follows the ISO standard double lane change maneuver using the PyChrono API .
	    Set a target speed of 10.0 for the path-follower driver.
	    Configure the steering controller with a look-ahead distance of 5 and appropriate gains.
	    Configure the speed controller with appropriate gains.
2.	Initial Vehicle Location Change:
	    Change the initial location of the vehicle from (0, 0, 0.5) to (-50, 0, 0.5) so that the double lane change maneuver can fit within the terrain patch
3.	Terrain Length Change:
	    Increase the terrain length from 100.0 to 200.0 so that the double lane change maneuver can fit within the terrain patch

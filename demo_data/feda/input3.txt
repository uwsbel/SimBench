	    Add point lights to the scene and set an appropriate intensity so that the scene is well illuminated.
3.	Camera Sensor Addition:
	Add a camera sensor to the vehicleâ€™s chassis body so as to get a First Person View from the camera. Set a high resolution and an appropriate Field Of View.
	Add a visualization filter to render the image and include it in the sensor manager.
4.	Sensor Manager Update in Simulation Loop:
	Insert the appropriate API to ensure that the camera is updated as the vehicle moves and that the camera filter is visible in visualization.

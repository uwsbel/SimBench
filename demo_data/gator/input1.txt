Create a PyChrono simulation of a Gator vehicle on a flat rigid terrain using Irrlicht for visualization. Initialize the vehicle with parameters such as location, orientation, contact method, and TMEASY tire model. Use mesh visualization for all vehicle components, and set up a RigidTerrain with specified dimensions and a custom texture. Implement an interactive driver system that allows control over the vehicleâ€™s steering, throttle, and braking, and ensure the simulation loop updates vehicle dynamics and rendering at 50 frames per second in real time.

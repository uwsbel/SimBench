1.	Visualization Type Change:
	    Simplify the visualization from mesh to primitives
2.	Chassis Collision Type Change:
    	Add a collision for the mesh. However, keep the collision simple with primitive shapes rather than using a mesh.
3.	Driver System Time Response Change:
        Make the driver less responsive. That is, when I press the keyboard controls I want the controls in the simulation to take more time to apply.

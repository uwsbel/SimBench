Based on the given input code, please modify it to include the following changes:


1. **Add Bevel Gear**:
   - Introduce a new bevel gear (gear D) with a radius of `5`.
   - Position this gear at `(-10, 0, -9)`, rotate it by `90` degrees around the Z-axis, and link it to the truss with a revolute joint along the horizontal axis.
   - Create a 1:1 gear ratio between gear A and gear D.

2. **Add a Pulley**:
   - Introduce a new pulley (pulley E) with a radius of `2`.
   - Position this pulley at `(-10, -11, -9)`, rotate it by `90` degrees around the Z-axis, and link it to the truss with a revolute joint along the horizontal axis.
   - Create a synchro belt constraint between gear D and pulley E.

3. **Visualization Enhancements**:
   - Add visual shapes and materials for the new bevel gear and pulley.
   - Include simplified visual representation of the belt linking gear D and pulley E during the scene rendering.

Ensure these modifications are correctly implemented in the code and verify the simulation for accuracy and smooth dynamics. Don't forget to test and visualize the newly added gears and pulley mechanism to ensure proper interaction and movement according to the gear ratios and constraints.

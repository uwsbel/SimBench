Create a PyChrono simulation featuring an HMMWV vehicle with a full system setup, including terrain, driver inputs, and visual interface using Irrlicht. Add and manage IMU and GPS sensors attached to the vehicle's chassis, processing and updating sensor data at each simulation step. Run a simulation loop that synchronizes and advances the vehicle, terrain, driver, and visual system modules while outputting vehicle mass and rendering scenes.

Added Logging Step Size:
Defined log_step_size to control the frequency of data logging.

Initialized GPS Data List:
Added a list gps_data to store the GPS coordinates.

Added GPS Data Logging:
Implemented a mechanism to log GPS data at intervals defined by log_steps. The GPS data is retrieved using gps.GetMostRecentGPSBuffer().GetGPSData() and appended to gps_data.

Modified Driver Inputs:
Changed the driver inputs to include specific throttle and steering commands based on the simulation time, and introduced braking after 6 seconds.

Added GPS Data Output:
Printed the logged GPS data at the end of the simulation loop with print("GPS Data: ", gps_data).

Changed IMU Sensor Offset Pose:
Modified the IMU sensor's offset pose from chrono.ChVector3d(-8, 0, 1) to chrono.ChVector3d(0, 0, 1).

Modified Driver Inputs:
Simplified the driver inputs to maintain a constant steering of 0.6 and throttle of 0.5 throughout the simulation.

Added Matplotlib Plot:
At the end of the simulation, added a Matplotlib plot to visualize the GPS data. The GPS trajectory is plotted with latitude and longitude axes.

Create a PyChrono simulation integrated with ROS. Set up a Chrono system with gravitational acceleration and physical material properties, then add a fixed floor and a movable box to the system. Create a custom ROS handler to publish integer messages to a specified topic. Configure the ROS manager with clock, body, and transform handlers, and register the custom handler. Run a simulation loop, advancing the system and updating ROS communication at each timestep, while maintaining real-time execution.

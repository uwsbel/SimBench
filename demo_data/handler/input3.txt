1. Added visualization setup with Irrlicht, including setting up a camera, lights, and window properties.
2. Set textures for the floor and box using `SetTexture` method with paths to texture files.
3. Added `publish_rate` variable set to 10 Hz for the ROS handlers.
4. Introduced variables for controlling rendering frame rate: `step_number`, `render_step_size`, and `render_steps`.
5. Modified the simulation loop to include conditional rendering, updating the scene every few steps based on the `render_steps` variable.

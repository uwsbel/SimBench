Create a PyChrono simulation of a full HMMWV (High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle) on a flat rigid terrain using Irrlicht for visualization. Initialize the vehicle with specific parameters such as location, orientation, contact method, and TMEASY tire model, and use primitive visualization for the vehicle components. Set up a RigidTerrain with defined dimensions and texture, and configure an interactive driver system for steering, throttle, and braking. Ensure the simulation loop runs in real time at 50 frames per second, updating the vehicle dynamics and rendering the scene.

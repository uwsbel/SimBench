3.	Path and Controller Implementation:
		Implement a circular path with a reasonable radius.
		Visualize the path using two balls.
		Use a constant throttle value of 0.3 and use a PID controller with appropriate gains for steering control

2.	Terrain Length Change:
		Increase the terrain length from 100.0 to 200.0 to ensure that the circular path fits within the terrain dimensions

4.	Simulation Loop Updates:
        You will have to use the PyChrono API to figure out the changes that need to be made within the simulation loop. In particular, stuff related to the driver will need to change since now instead of an interactive driver, we have a path follower.
5.	Visualization of Controller Points:
		Add visualization for the sentinel and target points using spheres for the user to visualize the path being followed.

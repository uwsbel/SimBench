1.	Driver System Replacement:
		Replace the existing driver system with a custom driver class.
		Initialize the custom driver with a delay parameter of 0.5.
2.	    Custom Driver Class Implementation:
		Implement a custom driver class MyDriver that inherits from veh.ChDriver base class.
		Override the Synchronize method to control throttle, steering, and braking based on simulation time with:
		A delay in driver inputs.
		Throttle gradually increasing to 0.7 after 0.2 seconds.
		Steering using a sinusoidal pattern starting at 2 seconds.
3.	Simulation End Condition:
		Add a condition to end the simulation when the simulation time reaches 4 seconds.

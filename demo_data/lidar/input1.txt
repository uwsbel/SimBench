Create a PyChrono simulation where a triangular mesh from a Wavefront .obj file is visualized as a fixed body in the scene. Add a lidar sensor to the body using a sensor manager, applying noise filters, visualizations, and saving options to the lidar data. Simulate the system while dynamically updating the lidar's position in an orbit around the mesh, and print lidar buffer data at each simulation step.

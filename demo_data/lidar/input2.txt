Removed Mesh Loading and Scaling:
Removed the loading and scaling of the mesh from the .obj file.

Added Box Object:
Added a box object with dimensions specified by side and set its position and texture.

Changed Lidar Attachment:
Attached the lidar to the box instead of the mesh body.

Created an Additional 2D Lidar Sensor:
Added a new 2D lidar sensor (lidar_2d) with one vertical channel and set its parameters.
Added the 2D lidar to the sensor manager and included appropriate filters and visualizations.

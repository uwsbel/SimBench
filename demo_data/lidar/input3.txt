Changed System Initialization:
Replaced the direct Chrono system initialization with the creation and initialization of an ARTcar vehicle. The vehicle parameters were set, and the vehicle system was used as the main physical system.

Added Vehicle Driver:
Initialized a driver for the vehicle with default settings.

Added Terrain:
Created a rigid terrain with specified material properties, texture, and color.

Changed Lidar Attachment:
Attached the lidar sensors (both 3D and 2D) to the vehicle chassis instead of the box.

Changed Lidar Offset Pose:
Modified the lidar offset pose from chrono.ChVector3d(-12, 0, 1) to chrono.ChVector3d(1.0, 0, 1).

Added Third Person Camera:
Added a third person view camera sensor attached to the vehicle chassis.

Updated Simulation Loop:
Updated the simulation loop to include synchronization and advancement of the vehicle, driver, and terrain modules in addition to the sensor manager and physical system dynamics.

Create a PyChrono simulation showcasing the dynamics of a MAN 10t truck driving on a rigid terrain. The system includes a vehicle model with configurable visualization and collision settings, a TMEASY tire model, and real-time driver controls for steering, throttle, and braking. Visualize the simulation using the Irrlicht visualization system with a chase camera, directional lighting, a skybox, and customizable terrain textures and logos.

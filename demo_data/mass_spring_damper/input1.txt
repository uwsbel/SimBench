Generate a PyChrono script that demonstrates a single mass-spring-damper system using `ChLinkTSDA` to connect a mass to the ground. Ensure the simulation includes Irrlicht visualization with appropriate lighting and camera settings, and provide visual shapes for the mass and spring in the scene. Use default linear spring-damper parameters for the `ChLinkTSDA` connection.

1. **Replace the Particle Creator**:
   - Change the particle shape creator from `chrono.ChRandomShapeCreatorConvexHulls` to `chrono.ChRandomShapeCreatorSpheres`.
   - Configure the new `mcreator_spheres` with appropriate diameter and density distributions:
     - Set the diameter distribution using `chrono.ChZhangDistribution` with parameters `0.6` and `0.23`.
     - Set the density distribution using `chrono.ChConstantDistribution` with a value of `1600`.

2. **Add Energy Calculations**:
   - Add variables to calculate the kinetic and potential energy of the system during each simulation step.
   - Compute the kinetic energy by iterating over all bodies, summing up `0.5 * mass * velocity.Length2()` for each body.
   - Compute the gravitational potential energy between each pair of bodies in combinations, summing up `-G_constant * (mass_A * mass_B) / r_attract` for each pair.
   - Sum these values to get the total energy and print the kinetic, potential, and total energy values in each simulation step.

3. **Adjust Position of `G_constant`**:
   - Move the definition of `G_constant` inside the simulation loop just before the energy calculations for better organization.

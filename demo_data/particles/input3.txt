1. **Add Two Additional Spheres for a Three-Body Simulation**:
   - Introduce two more `ChBodyEasySphere` objects to create a three-body problem.
   - Set initial positions for the new spheres:
     - Sphere 2: Position at `(-10, -10, 0)`.
     - Sphere 3: Position at `(0, 20, 0)`.
   - Configure initial velocities to simulate dynamic interactions:
     - Sphere 1: Velocity of `(0.5, 0, 0.1)`.
     - Sphere 2: Velocity of `(-0.5, 0, -0.1)`.
     - Sphere 3: Velocity of `(0, -0.5, 0.2)`.

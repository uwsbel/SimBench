Create a simulation of a simple pendulum using the PyChrono library with Irrlicht for visualization. Set up a ground body, a pendulum with appropriate mass and inertia, and connect them with a revolute joint. Use the visualization system to render the simulation and periodically log the pendulum's position and velocity.

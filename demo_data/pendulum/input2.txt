Based on the given single pendulum code, please modify it to include the following changes:

Change the visualization of the joint to a sphere with a radius of 2.
Adjust the mass of the pendulum to 2 kg and the inertia tensor to chrono.ChVector3d(0.4, 1.5, 1.5).
Modify the length of the pendulum by altering the dimensions of the visualization cylinder to a radius of 0.1 and a height of 1.5.
Set an initial angular velocity for the pendulum.
Change the gravitational acceleration to simulate the pendulum on the moon with chrono.ChVector3d(0, -1.62, 0).
Replace the revolute joint with a spherical joint.
Ensure these modifications are correctly implemented in the code and verify the simulation for accuracy and smooth dynamics. Fix any potential bugs or issues that may arise during the simulation.

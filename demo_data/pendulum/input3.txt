Based on the given single pendulum code, please modify it to create a double pendulum system. The new system should include an additional pendulum attached to the first one with appropriate joints and visualization. Ensure that both pendulums are able to move independently within the simulation. Additionally, fix any potential bugs in the provided code to ensure smooth and accurate simulation.

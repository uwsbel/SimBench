Create a PyChrono simulation of a full HMMWV (High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle) on a custom mesh terrain using Irrlicht for visualization. Initialize the vehicle with specific parameters such as location, orientation, contact method, and TMEASY tire model, utilizing mesh visualization for all vehicle components. Implement a custom terrain using collision and visual meshes (Highway_col.obj and Highway_vis.obj), and configure an interactive driver system for steering, throttle, and braking control. Ensure the simulation loop runs in real time at 50 frames per second, updating vehicle dynamics and rendering the scene.

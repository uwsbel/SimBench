Create a PyChrono simulation of an HMMWV (High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle) on a complex rigid terrain composed of multiple patches using Irrlicht for visualization. Initialize the vehicle with specific parameters including position, engine type, and drivetrain type, and apply mesh visualization to all vehicle components. Construct a terrain with diverse surface types, including flat patches with different textures and a mesh-based patch for a bump, as well as a heightmap-based patch for varying elevations. Incorporate an interactive driver system to control steering, throttle, and braking, ensuring the simulation updates at a consistent timestep while rendering the scene in real time.

Based on the given input code, please modify it to include the following changes:

1. **Initial Position Update:**
   - Change the initial position of the HMMWV vehicle from `ChVector3d(-10, -2, 0.6)` to `ChVector3d(6, -70, 0.5)`.

2. **Terrain Definition Simplification:**
   - Replace the multiple terrain patches (patch1, patch2, patch3, patch4) with a single terrain patch using a contact material with the same friction and restitution values.
   - The new terrain patch uses a mesh defined by the file `vehicle/terrain/meshes/Highway_col.obj`, with collision enabled and a contact material thickness of `0.01`.
   
3. **Add Visual Mesh to Terrain:**
   - Create a visual mesh for the terrain using the file `terrain/meshes/Highway_vis.obj`.
   - Add this visual mesh to the terrain's ground body using `ChVisualShapeTriangleMesh`.

4. **Remove Terrain Patches:**
   - Remove the individual patch definitions for `patch1`, `patch2`, `patch3`, and `patch4` from the original code.
   
5. **Mesh-Related Functions:**
   - Include mesh-related functions for creating and adding visual shapes to the terrain.

These changes adjust the vehicle's starting position and simplify the terrain configuration while adding a new visual representation for the terrain using a mesh file.

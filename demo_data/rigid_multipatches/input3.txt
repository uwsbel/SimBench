Based on the given input code, please modify it to include the following changes:

1. **Patch 1 Position Change:**
   - Update the position of Patch 1 by changing the `ChVector3d` coordinates from `(-16, 0, 0)` to `(-20, 5, 0)`.
   
2. **Patch 2 Position Change:**
   - Update the position of Patch 2 by changing the `ChVector3d` coordinates from `(16, 0, 0.15)` to `(20, -5, 0.2)`.
   
3. **Patch 3 Position Change:**
   - Update the position of Patch 3 by changing the `ChVector3d` coordinates from `(0, -42, 0)` to `(5, -45, 0)`.
   
4. **Patch 4 Position Change:**
   - Update the position of Patch 4 by changing the `ChVector3d` coordinates from `(0, 42, 0)` to `(10, 40, 0)`.

These changes involve updating the positions of the terrain patches, which affect the placement of various terrains within the simulation environment. All other functionalities remain the same, maintaining the vehicle and simulation setup.

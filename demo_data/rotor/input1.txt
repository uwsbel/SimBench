Generate a PyChrono simulation that models the dynamic behavior of a Jeffcott rotor using an Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) beam. The simulation should include the creation of a beam, attachment of a flywheel at its center, and a rotational motor that drives one end of the beam. The visual setup should include FEM visualization and an Irrlicht window to observe the dynamics of the beam and flywheel system.

1. **Change Beam Length:**
    - Beam length was changed from `6` to `10` units to demonstrate a longer beam.
    beam_L = 10


2. **Change Beam Thickness:**
    - Adjust the outer and inner radius of the beam from `0.050` and `0.045` to `0.060` and `0.055` respectively.
    beam_ro = 0.060
    beam_ri = 0.055

3. **Change Flywheel Dimensions:**
    - Flywheel radius was changed from `0.24` to `0.30`.
    mbodyflywheel = chrono.ChBodyEasyCylinder(chrono.ChAxis_Y, 0.30, 0.1, 7800)

4. **Change Gravitational Acceleration:**
    - Gravity vector was changed from downward (-9.81) to simulate a different environment, with lower gravity.
    sys.SetGravitationalAcceleration(chrono.ChVector3d(0, -3.71, 0))

5. **Change Motor Function:**
    - Motor function was revised from `Sine(40, 0.2)` to `Sine(60, 0.1)`.
    f_ramp = chrono.ChFunctionSine(60, 0.1)

6. **Change Camera Position:**
    - Camera position was modified to give a better view of the longer beam from `(0, 1, 4)` to `(0, 2, 8)`.

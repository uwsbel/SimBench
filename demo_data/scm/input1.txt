Create a PyChrono simulation of a full HMMWV (High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle) on SCM deformable terrain using Irrlicht for visualization. Initialize the vehicle with specific parameters including location, orientation, and a rigid tire model, applying mesh visualization to all vehicle components. Configure the SCM terrain with custom soil parameters, enabling a moving patch feature that dynamically follows the vehicle chassis. The terrain should visualize sinkage with false color plotting. Set up an interactive driver system to control steering, throttle, and braking, and ensure the simulation runs in real time, updating vehicle dynamics and rendering the scene at 50 frames per second.

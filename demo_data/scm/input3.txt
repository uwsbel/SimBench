Add Objects to the Scene:
    Introduce randomly positioned boxes in the simulation environment by creating and adding ChBodyEasyBox objects to the system while ensuring that a box is not initialized within the vehicle
Integrate a Sensor System:
    Add a sensor manager to the simulation and integrate point lights at various positions in the scene.
    Create a camera sensor attached to the vehicle chassis, configure its settings (e.g., resolution, field of view), and add it to the sensor manager.
    Include a filter to visualize the camera feed during the simulation.

Create a PyChrono simulation featuring an HMMWV vehicle with specific initial conditions and visualization settings. Set up an SCM deformable terrain with defined soil parameters and initialize it with a height map. Initialize a driver system for vehicle control and create a real-time visualization using Irrlicht with camera settings and lighting. Implement a simulation loop that synchronizes and advances the vehicle, terrain, driver, and visual system at each timestep, maintaining real-time execution.

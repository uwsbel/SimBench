Create a PyChrono simulation showcasing the dynamics of a BMW E90 Sedan driving on a rigid terrain. The system includes a vehicle with configurable visualization, collision settings, and a TMEASY tire model, driven by an interactive driver system for real-time control of steering, throttle, and braking. Visualize the simulation using the Irrlicht system with a chase camera, directional lighting, a skybox, and customizable textures and logos on the terrain surface.

Create a PyChrono simulation with various sensors attached to a ground body. Set up the Chrono system, add a mesh object for visualization, and configure the ground body to move. Integrate multiple sensors (camera, lidar, GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) using a sensor manager. Register these sensors with a ROS manager to publish data to specific ROS topics. Implement a simulation loop that updates the sensors, advances the simulation, and maintains real-time execution.

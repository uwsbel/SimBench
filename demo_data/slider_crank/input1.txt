Create a PyChrono simulation showcasing a simple crank-slider mechanism. The system should include a floor (truss), a crankshaft, a connecting rod, and a piston, connected via appropriate joints and driven by a motor to spin the crankshaft at a constant angular speed. Visualize the simulation using the Irrlicht visualization system with customizable camera settings, lighting, and additional visual elements like textures and logos.

1. **Joint Type Modifications**:
    - Change the joint type connecting the crank to the rod from `revolute (hinge)` to `spherical (ball-and-socket)`.
    - Change the joint type connecting the rod to the piston from `revolute (hinge)` to `spherical (ball-and-socket)`.
    - Replace the prismatic joint between the piston and the floor with a plane-plane (planar) joint that constrains the piston to move and rotate in the x-y plane.

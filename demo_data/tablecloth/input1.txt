Create a PyChrono simulation to model the folding of a tablecloth using shell elements. Implement an isotropic Kirchhoff material and generate a mesh grid for the tablecloth, adding nodes and elements accordingly. Set up an Irrlicht visualization system and use the PardisoMKL solver to efficiently handle the simulation's dynamics.

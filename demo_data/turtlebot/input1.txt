Create a PyChrono simulation with a Turtlebot robot on a rigid terrain. Set up the Chrono system with gravity and a ground body, then initialize the Turtlebot with a specific position and orientation. Create a real-time visualization using Irrlicht with camera settings and lighting. Implement a simulation loop where the Turtlebot's motors control left and right turns at specified times, updating and rendering the robot at each timestep.

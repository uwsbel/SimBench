1. Ground position adjusted from `chrono.ChVector3d(0, 0, -1)` to `chrono.ChVector3d(0, 0, -0.6)`.
2. Removed the commented-out line for enabling shadows: `# vis.EnableShadows()`.
3. Added a new function `move(mode)` to control the robot's movement with modes: `straight`, `left`, `right`. This function sets the motor speeds based on the mode and raises a `ValueError` for an invalid mode.
4. Updated the simulation loop to:
   - Move the robot straight for the first 5 seconds.
   - Turn the robot left for the next 5 seconds.
   - Turn the robot right thereafter.
   - Added `print` statements to indicate the robot's current action.

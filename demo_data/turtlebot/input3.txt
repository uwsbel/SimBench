1. Ground position adjusted from `chrono.ChVector3d(0, 0, -1)` to `chrono.ChVector3d(0, 0, -0.6)`.
2. Added sensor manager and configured lidar sensor:
   - Imported `pychrono.sensor` as `sens`.
   - Created and added a sensor manager.
   - Configured and added a lidar sensor with various parameters and filters.
3. Added randomly placed boxes:
   - Created 5 boxes with random positions for interaction.
4. Added motion control function for Turtlebot:
   - `move(mode)` function to control Turtlebot's movement with modes: `straight`, `left`, `right`.
5. Updated simulation loop:
   - Used `move('straight')` function for Turtlebot's movement.
   - Added sensor manager update within the loop.

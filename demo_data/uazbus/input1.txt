Create a PyChrono simulation featuring a UAZBUS vehicle with specified initial conditions and visualization settings. Set up a rigid terrain with defined friction and restitution. Initialize a driver system for vehicle control and create a real-time visualization using Irrlicht with camera settings and lighting. Implement a simulation loop that synchronizes and advances the vehicle, terrain, driver, and visual system at each timestep, maintaining real-time execution.

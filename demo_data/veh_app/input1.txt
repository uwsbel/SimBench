Create a PyChrono simulation featuring a Gator vehicle, including its initialization and visualization with various vehicle parts set to different visualization types. Add a rigid terrain and an interactive driver system. Set up a sensor manager with point lights and a camera attached to the vehicle's chassis, rendering the camera images. Run a simulation loop, updating the driver, terrain, vehicle, and sensor manager at each timestep, while synchronizing and advancing the simulation modules.

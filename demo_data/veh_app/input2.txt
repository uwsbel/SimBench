Initial Vehicle Location:
Changed initLoc from chrono.ChVector3d(0, 0, 0.4) to chrono.ChVector3d(0, -5, 0.4).

Added Box Object:
Added a box object to the system with dimensions 1, 1, 1, positioned at chrono.ChVector3d(0, 0, 0.5), and applied a blue texture.

Added Cylinder Object:
Added a cylinder object to the system with a radius of 0.5 and a height of 1, positioned at chrono.ChVector3d(0, 0, 1.5), and applied a blue texture.

Added Lidar Sensor:
Created and added a Lidar sensor to the system with the following specifications:
- Offset pose at chrono.ChVector3d(0.0, 0, 2)
- 800 horizontal samples
- 300 vertical channels
- 360 degrees horizontal field of view (2 * chrono.CH_PI)
- Maximum vertical field of view of chrono.CH_PI / 12
- Minimum vertical field of view of -chrono.CH_PI / 6
- Maximum range of 100.0
- Rectangular beam shape
- Sample radius of 2
- Divergence angle of 0.003
- Strongest return mode
- Applied filters for Depth, Intensity data, XYZI point cloud data, and visualization

Changed Driver Inputs:
Modified driver inputs to set the steering to 0.5 and throttle to 0.2 within the simulation loop.

Create a PyChrono simulation featuring an HMMWV vehicle with specific parameters such as contact method, engine type, and tire model. Set up a terrain with defined friction and restitution. Initialize a driver system for vehicle control. Integrate ROS for communication, registering handlers for clock synchronization, driver inputs, and vehicle state. Implement a simulation loop that synchronizes and advances the vehicle, terrain, and driver systems at each timestep, updating the ROS manager for data publishing.

    "instruction": "You are a PyChrono expert tasked with generating a simulation script based on the following instructions. Make sure to:\n        1. Initialize the PyChrono environment and core components.\n        2. Add the required physical systems and objects as specified.\n        3. Set necessary default parameters such as positions, forces, and interactions.\n\n        Instructions:\n        Create a PyChrono simulation featuring an HMMWV vehicle with specific parameters such as contact method, engine type, and tire model. Set up a terrain with defined friction and restitution. Initialize a driver system for vehicle control. Integrate ROS for communication, registering handlers for clock synchronization, driver inputs, and vehicle state. Implement a simulation loop that synchronizes and advances the vehicle, terrain, and driver systems at each timestep, updating the ROS manager for data publishing.\n        ",

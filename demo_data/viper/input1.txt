Create a PyChrono simulation with a Viper rover on a rigid terrain. Set up the Chrono system with gravity and ground body, then initialize the Viper rover and its driver. Create a real-time visualization using Irrlicht with camera settings and lighting. Implement a simulation loop where the rover's steering gradually changes over a specified time period, updating and rendering the rover at each timestep.

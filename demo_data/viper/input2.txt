Changes observed between the original and new code:

1. Import statement added for `pychrono.sensor` as `sens`.

2. Creation of a sensor manager:
   - Added the following lines to create a sensor manager and add a point light to the scene:
     ```
     manager = sens.ChSensorManager(system)
     intensity = 1.0
     manager.scene.AddPointLight(chrono.ChVector3f(2, 2.5, 100), chrono.ChColor(intensity, intensity, intensity), 500.0)
     ```

3. Creation of a camera sensor:
   - Added the following lines to create a camera sensor, set its properties, and add it to the sensor manager:
     ```
     offset_pose = chrono.ChFramed(chrono.ChVector3d(1.0, 0, 1.45), chrono.QuatFromAngleAxis(.2, chrono.ChVector3d(0, 1, 0)))
     cam = sens.ChCameraSensor(
         rover.GetChassis().GetBody(),
         15, # update rate
         offset_pose,
         720, # image width
         480, # image height
         1.408 # field of view
     )
     cam.SetName("Third Person POV")
     cam.PushFilter(sens.ChFilterVisualize(720, 480, "Viper Front Camera"))
     manager.AddSensor(cam)
     ```

4. Addition of variables for simulation step and render step size:
   - Added the following lines to define `step_number`, `render_step_size`, and `render_steps`:
     ```
     step_number = 0
     render_step_size = 1.0 / 25  # FPS = 25
     render_steps = math.ceil(render_step_size / time_step)
     ```

5. Modification of the simulation loop to update the sensor manager and render the scene at specific intervals:
   - Added `manager.Update()` inside the simulation loop.
   - Modified the rendering part to only render the scene at specific intervals:
     ```
     if (step_number % render_steps == 0):
         vis.BeginScene()
         vis.Render()
         vis.EndScene()
     step_number += 1
     ```

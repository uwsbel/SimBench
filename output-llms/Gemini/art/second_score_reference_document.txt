### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script, such as system initialization, vehicle creation, visualization setup, and simulation loop. Therefore, no points are deducted in this category.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The script correctly uses the PyChrono API, and there are no significant changes in simulation behavior compared to the reference script. All parameters and methods align with the reference.
   - There are no logical errors or incorrect settings of body properties.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. However, there are some comments that could be more descriptive, especially regarding the purpose of certain parameters.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted** for insufficient comments.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit any unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows the same structure as the reference script, which is efficient.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The script lacks explicit error handling mechanisms, such as checks for successful initialization or valid input parameters. The reference script does not explicitly handle errors either, but it is generally good practice to include some basic checks.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted** for lack of error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is consistent with the reference script, including the addition of lights, skybox, and vehicle attachment. There are no significant issues in this area.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points deducted
- Correctness: 0 points deducted
- Code Quality: 5 points deducted
- Efficiency: 0 points deducted
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points deducted
- Use of Visualization Tools: 0 points deducted

### Final Score Calculation
Total deductions: 10 points
Maximum score: 100 points
Final score: 100 - 10 = 90

**Final Score: [[90]]**

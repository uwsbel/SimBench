### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, mesh creation, and visualization setup. However, it lacks the explicit setting of the centroid, shear center, and section rotation, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Component Configuration**: The provided code has some components that are present but lack important details compared to the reference. For example, the `SetCentroid`, `SetShearCenter`, and `SetSectionRotation` methods are commented out and not utilized, leading to a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Minor Omissions**: There are minor deviations, such as the use of `chrono.ChVectorD` instead of `chrono.ChVector3d`, which is not consistent with the reference. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Completeness: 30 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: The use of `chrono.ChVectorD` instead of `chrono.ChVector3d` is a significant deviation that could affect the simulation behavior. This leads to a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: The code correctly initializes nodes and elements, but the approach to applying forces and torques is slightly different from the reference. However, this does not lead to a significant logical error, so no deduction is applied here.
   - **Minor Inaccuracies**: There are minor inaccuracies in the comments and some unnecessary API calls, such as the commented-out lines for setting centroid and shear center. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Correctness: 20 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured and readable, but the comments could be more descriptive in some areas. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Documentation**: The comments are somewhat sufficient but lack depth compared to the reference script. This leads to an additional deduction of **5 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Code Quality: 10 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: There are no significant inefficiencies in the code compared to the reference. However, the commented-out lines could be considered unnecessary, leading to a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Optimization Opportunities**: The code does not fully utilize the `ChBuilderBeamEuler` for creating beams, which is a more efficient approach. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Efficiency: 8 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Basic Error Handling**: The code lacks any explicit error handling mechanisms, which could lead to issues during execution. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Error Handling: 5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor issues with the lighting and camera setup compared to the reference. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools: 3 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 20 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 8 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 76 points
- Final Score: 100 - 76 = 24 points

### Final Score Output

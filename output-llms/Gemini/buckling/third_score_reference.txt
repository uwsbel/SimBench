### Evaluation of the Provided Code Against the Reference Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code lacks the correct initialization of the truss body and its visualization shape. The reference script uses `chrono.ChBody()` and `chrono.ChVisualShapeBox()`, while the provided code uses `chrono.ChBodyEasyBox()` and does not attach a visualization shape correctly. **(15 points)**
     - The output directory is set to "BEAM_FAILED" in the provided code, while the reference script uses "BEAM_BUCKLING". This is a minor omission but still a deviation. **(5 points)**
   - **Incorrect Configuration (10 points)**: 
     - The provided code uses `chrono.ChLinkMotorRotationSpeed()` instead of `chrono.ChLinkMotorRotationAngle()`, which changes the motor's behavior. **(10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: **30 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage (15 points each)**: 
     - The use of `chrono.ChFrameD()` instead of `chrono.ChFramed()` in motor initialization is incorrect and could lead to significant changes in behavior. **(15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors (10 points)**: 
     - The reference script uses `chrono.ChVector3d()` for vector definitions, while the provided code uses `chrono.ChVectorD()`, which may lead to inconsistencies in the simulation. **(10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: **25 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code is generally readable, but there are instances of inconsistent naming conventions (e.g., `body_trss` vs. `body_truss`). **(5 points)**
   - **Comments (5 points)**: 
     - The comments are mostly adequate, but some could be more descriptive, especially regarding the purpose of certain sections. **(5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code has some redundant calculations, such as the repeated use of `chrono.ChVectorD()` instead of storing vectors in variables. **(5 points)**
   - **Missing Optimizations (3 points)**: 
     - The reference script uses fewer elements in the beam construction, which could lead to better performance. **(3 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **8 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which could lead to issues during execution. **(5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling**: **5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Visualization Setup (3 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not set up the visualization shapes correctly for the truss and crank bodies, which is a significant oversight. **(3 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: **3 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 8 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 25 + 5 + 8 + 5 + 3 = 76 points
- Final Score: 100 - 76 = 24 points

### Final Score Output

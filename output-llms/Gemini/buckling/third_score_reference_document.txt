### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code has all essential components present in the reference script, including system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. Therefore, no points are deducted here.
   - **Incorrect Configuration**: The `body_trss` is created using `ChBodyEasyBox`, which is a valid approach, but it lacks the explicit visualization shape that the reference script has. This is a significant omission. **Deduct 10 points**.
   - **Minor Omissions**: The output directory is set to "BEAM_FAILED" instead of "BEAM_BUCKLING," which is a minor deviation. **Deduct 5 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Completeness: 15 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: The use of `SetBodyFixed` instead of `SetFixed` is incorrect as it should be `SetFixed`. This could lead to a significant change in simulation behavior. **Deduct 15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: The motor is initialized with `ChLinkMotorRotationSpeed`, while the reference uses `ChLinkMotorRotationAngle`. This could lead to different simulation dynamics. **Deduct 10 points**.
   - **Minor Inaccuracies**: The `Get_y` method in the custom function class uses `Get_y` instead of `GetVal`, which is a minor inaccuracy. **Deduct 5 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Correctness: 30 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured and readable. However, there are some inconsistencies in naming conventions (e.g., `body_trss` vs. `body_truss`). **Deduct 5 points**.
   - **Comments**: The comments are generally sufficient but could be improved for clarity in some areas. **Deduct 5 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Code Quality: 10 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: There are no significant inefficiencies or redundant calculations compared to the reference script. Therefore, no points are deducted here.
   - **Optimization Opportunities**: The code could benefit from some optimizations, such as using constants for repeated values, but these are not glaring omissions. **Deduct 3 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Efficiency: 3 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Basic Error Handling**: The code lacks any explicit error handling or checks for potential issues (e.g., checking if the mesh is successfully created). **Deduct 5 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor issues with the size of visual shapes compared to the reference script. **Deduct 3 points**.
   - **Minor Visualization Issues**: The lighting and camera setup are adequate, so no additional points are deducted here.

   **Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 15 points
- Correctness: 30 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a full score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 66 points
- Final Score: 100 - 66 = 34 points

### Final Score Output

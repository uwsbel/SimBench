### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided script lacks several essential components compared to the reference script:
     - **Setting the contact method**: The reference script explicitly sets the contact method (`chrono.ChContactMethod_SMC`), which is missing in the provided script. **(15 points deduction)**
     - **Vehicle initialization details**: The reference script initializes the vehicle with specific parameters (e.g., driveline type, engine type, etc.), which are not present in the provided script. **(15 points deduction)**
     - **Driver system initialization**: The reference script uses `ChInteractiveDriverIRR`, which is more suitable for interactive simulations compared to the generic `ChDriver` used in the provided script. **(10 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 40 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: The provided script uses `veh.WheeledVehicle`, which is not the same as the `veh.M113()` used in the reference. This could lead to significant differences in simulation behavior. **(15 points deduction)**
   - **Logical Errors**: The provided script does not set the vehicle's visualization type or collision type, which are crucial for accurate simulation and visualization. **(10 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided script is relatively readable, but it lacks meaningful comments and documentation compared to the reference script, which provides better context for each section. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The provided script initializes the visualization and updates it in a less efficient manner compared to the reference script, which has a more structured approach to rendering frames. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided script does not include any error handling or checks for successful initialization of components, which the reference script implicitly handles. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The provided script does not set up the visualization as comprehensively as the reference script, which includes additional visual elements like a logo and a chase camera. **(3 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 40 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 83 points
- Final Score: 100 - 83 = 17 points

### Final Score Output

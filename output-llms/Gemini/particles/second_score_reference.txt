### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, visualization, and particle emission. Therefore, no points are deducted in this category.
   - **Score: 40/40**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The gravitational constant is incorrectly set to `6.674e-11` instead of `6.674e-3`, which is a significant error affecting the potential energy calculations. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - The calculation of kinetic energy is correct, but the potential energy calculation should be done before the force accumulation loop, which is a logical error. This results in an additional deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Score: 5/30** (15 points for incorrect gravitational constant, 10 points for logical error)

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. However, there are minor formatting inconsistencies, such as spacing and line breaks, which could be improved. Thus, a deduction of **5 points** is warranted.
   - **Score: 5/10**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code contains unnecessary calculations, particularly in the potential energy calculation loop where the force accumulation is done after calculating total energy. This could be optimized. Therefore, a deduction of **5 points** is appropriate.
   - **Score: 5/10**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The code lacks basic error handling for potential issues such as division by zero in the potential energy calculations. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Score: 0/5**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor issues such as the lack of comments explaining the visualization setup. Therefore, a deduction of **3 points** is warranted.
   - **Score: 2/5**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points deducted
- Correctness: 25 points deducted (15 for gravitational constant, 10 for logical error)
- Code Quality: 5 points deducted
- Efficiency: 5 points deducted
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points deducted
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points deducted

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a total of 100 points:
- 100 - 0 (Completeness) 
- 100 - 25 (Correctness) 
- 100 - 5 (Code Quality) 
- 100 - 5 (Efficiency) 
- 100 - 5 (Error Handling) 
- 100 - 3 (Visualization)

Final Score: 100 - 43 = 57

### Final Score Output

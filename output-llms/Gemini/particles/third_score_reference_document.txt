### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components: system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. However, there are some minor deviations in the setup of the spheres (e.g., initial positions and velocities). 
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for minor deviations in sphere initialization.
   - **Score**: 35/40

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code uses `SetPos_dt` instead of `SetPosDt`, which is incorrect and could lead to issues in setting the initial velocities of the spheres. Additionally, the gravitational constant is modified incorrectly in the provided code (6.674e-10 instead of 6.674e-3).
   - **Deductions**: 15 points for incorrect API usage (SetPos_dt) and 15 points for the incorrect gravitational constant.
   - **Score**: 0/30

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of various sections and choices made in the code. The variable names are meaningful, but additional comments would enhance clarity.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments.
   - **Score**: 5/10

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code performs unnecessary calculations, particularly in the energy calculations and force accumulations, which could be optimized. The reference script does not show any redundant calculations that could be avoided.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for unnecessary calculations.
   - **Score**: 5/10

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for potential issues (e.g., division by zero in potential energy calculations). The reference script does not explicitly handle these either, but it is a common best practice to include such checks.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of error handling.
   - **Score**: 0/5

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the title of the window differs from the reference script, which could lead to confusion about the simulation's purpose.
   - **Deductions**: 3 points for inadequate visualization setup (different window title).
   - **Score**: 2/5

### Final Score Calculation
- Completeness: 35/40
- Correctness: 0/30
- Code Quality: 5/10
- Efficiency: 5/10
- Error Handling and Robustness: 0/5
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2/5

**Total Score**: 35 + 0 + 5 + 5 + 0 + 2 = 47/100

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. No points are deducted here.
   - **Incorrectly Configured Components**: The pendulum's initial angular velocity is set using `SetWvel_loc`, which is incorrect. The reference uses `SetPosDt` for setting the initial linear velocity. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Minor Omissions**: The visualization of the ground body uses a cylinder instead of a sphere as in the reference. This is a minor deviation, resulting in a deduction of **5 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 15 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of PyChrono API**: The use of `chrono.ChLinkSphere()` instead of `chrono.ChLinkMateSpherical()` is a significant change in joint behavior, leading to a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: The initial angular velocity is incorrectly set, as mentioned above, leading to a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Minor Inaccuracies**: The time step in `sys.DoStepDynamics(1e-3)` is smaller than the reference's `1e-2`, which may not be a significant error but is a deviation from the reference. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 30 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured and readable. However, the variable names could be more descriptive (e.g., `sph_1` could be `spherical_joint`), leading to a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Comments**: The comments are adequate but could be improved for clarity, especially regarding the purpose of certain settings. No additional points are deducted here.

   **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The time step in the simulation loop is smaller than necessary, which could lead to inefficiencies. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Missing Optimization Opportunities**: There are no significant missed optimization opportunities compared to the reference. No additional points are deducted here.

   **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling**: The code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which could lead to issues during runtime. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Visualization Setup**: The ground body visualization uses a cylinder instead of a sphere, leading to a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Minor Visualization Issues**: The lighting and camera setup are adequate, so no additional points are deducted.

   **Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 15 points
- Correctness: 30 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
The total deductions amount to **63 points** from a maximum of **100 points**.

**Final Score**: 100 - 63 = **37**

### Final Score Output

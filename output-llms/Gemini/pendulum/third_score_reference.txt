### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components (15 points each)**: 
     - The ground body in the provided code has collision detection enabled, while the reference script disables it. This is a significant difference as it may affect the simulation behavior. **(15 points deduction)**
     - The reference script uses `ChFramed` for visual shapes, while the provided code uses `ChFrameD`. While both are valid, the reference script's choice is more consistent with its other components. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 20 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code uses `SetCollide(True)` for the ground and pendulums, while the reference script uses `EnableCollision(False)`. This could lead to different simulation behaviors. **(15 points deduction)**
   - **Logical Errors (10 points each)**: 
     - The initialization of the revolute joints in the provided code does not match the reference script's use of `ChFramed` and `ChQuaterniond`. This could lead to incorrect joint behavior. **(10 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 to 10 points)**: 
     - The provided code is generally readable, but the use of different naming conventions (e.g., `ChFrameD` vs. `ChFramed`) and inconsistent comments can lead to confusion. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Insufficient Comments (5 points)**: 
     - While the code is commented, it lacks some clarity compared to the reference script, which provides more context. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 10 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations or Redundant Code (5 points each)**: 
     - The time step in the simulation loop is set to `1e-3`, while the reference script uses `1e-2`. This could lead to unnecessary computations without improving accuracy. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for potential issues, which is a significant oversight compared to the reference script. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Incorrect or Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 to 5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not include a skybox or logo in the same manner as the reference script, which may affect the visual quality. **(3 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 20 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 20 + 25 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 68 points
- Final Score: 100 - 68 = 32

### Final Score Output

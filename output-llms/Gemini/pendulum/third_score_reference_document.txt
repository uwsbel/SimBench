### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The provided script does not disable collision detection for the ground and pendulum bodies, which is present in the reference script. This is a significant omission as it can affect simulation performance and accuracy. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - The reference script uses `ChFramed` for visual shapes, while the provided script uses `ChFrameD`. This is a minor deviation but still affects completeness. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 20 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: 
     - The provided script uses `SetCollide(True)` instead of `EnableCollision(False)`, which can lead to unintended collision detection. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The initialization of the revolute joints uses `chrono.QUNIT` instead of `chrono.ChQuaterniond(1, 0, 0, 0)`, which is the correct representation for the reference script. This can lead to incorrect joint behavior. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The code is generally well-structured, but the variable names could be more descriptive (e.g., `cyl_g`, `cyl_1`, `cyl_2`). This affects readability. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Comments**: 
     - The comments are present but could be more detailed, especially regarding the purpose of certain configurations. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 10 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The time step in `sys.DoStepDynamics(1e-3)` is smaller than in the reference script (`1e-2`), which is less efficient for the same simulation. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided script does not include any error handling or checks for the simulation state, which is present in the reference script. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: 
     - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the window title is less descriptive compared to the reference script. **(Deduct 2 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 2 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 20 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a total of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 67 points
- Final Score: 100 - 67 = 33 points

### Final Score Output

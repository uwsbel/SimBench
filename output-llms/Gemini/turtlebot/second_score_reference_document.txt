### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script, such as system initialization, ground body creation, robot creation, and visualization setup. Therefore, no points are deducted in this category.
   - **Score: 40/40**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The movement control logic for the robot is slightly different from the reference script. In the reference, the robot's motor speeds for turning left and right are set to different values, which allows for a more realistic turning motion. The provided code sets both motors to the same speed for straight movement, which is correct, but the turning speeds are not optimized as in the reference.
   - **Score: 20/30** (10 points deducted for logical errors in motor speed settings)

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The provided code is well-structured and readable, with appropriate use of comments. However, the comments could be more detailed in explaining the purpose of certain sections, especially in the movement function.
   - **Score: 8/10** (2 points deducted for insufficient comments)

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code is efficient and does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows the structure of the reference script closely.
   - **Score: 10/10**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The error handling in the `move` function is adequate, raising a `ValueError` for invalid modes. However, there is no handling for potential issues that could arise during the simulation loop, such as checking if the visualization system is properly initialized.
   - **Score: 3/5** (2 points deducted for lack of robustness in the simulation loop)

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is correctly implemented, similar to the reference script. However, there are minor differences in the way the robot's movement is printed to the console, which could be improved for clarity.
   - **Score: 4/5** (1 point deducted for minor visualization issues)

### Final Score Calculation
- Completeness: 40/40
- Correctness: 20/30
- Code Quality: 8/10
- Efficiency: 10/10
- Error Handling and Robustness: 3/5
- Use of Visualization Tools: 4/5

**Total Score: 40 + 20 + 8 + 10 + 3 + 4 = 85**

### Final Score Output

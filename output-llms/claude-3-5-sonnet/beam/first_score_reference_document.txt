### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks the initialization of a solver (e.g., MKL Pardiso) which is present in the reference script. This is crucial for FEA simulations. **(15 points deduction)**
     - The reference script includes constraints connecting nodes to a fixed truss, which are absent in the provided code. **(15 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: 
     - The provided code uses `chrono.ChSystemNSC()` while the reference uses `chrono.ChSystemSMC()`, which is more appropriate for FEA simulations. This could lead to significant differences in simulation behavior. **(15 points deduction)**
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The force applied to `nodeC` is not consistent with the reference script, which applies forces and torques to different nodes. This could affect the simulation's dynamics. **(10 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The provided code is relatively well-structured but lacks comments explaining the purpose of each section, which is present in the reference script. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The provided code does not optimize the visualization setup as effectively as the reference script, which includes more detailed visual shapes and settings. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the simulation state, which is a basic requirement for robustness. The reference script handles constraints and connections more carefully. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The visualization setup in the provided code is less comprehensive than in the reference script, which includes additional visual elements and settings. **(3 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 73 points
- Final Score: 100 - 73 = 27 points

### Final Score Output

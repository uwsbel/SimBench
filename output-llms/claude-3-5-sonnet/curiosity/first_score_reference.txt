### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code lacks the creation of a contact material for the ground, which is present in the reference script. **(15 points)**
     - The reference script initializes a rover and its driver, which is entirely absent in the provided code. **(15 points)**
   - **Incorrect Configuration (10 points)**: 
     - The gravity vector is set using `Set_G_acc`, which is not the same as `SetGravitationalAcceleration` in the reference. This is a significant deviation. **(10 points)**
   - **Minor Omissions (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not include a texture for the ground, which is a minor but notable omission. **(5 points)**

   **Total Deductions for Completeness: 15 + 15 + 10 + 5 = 45 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API (15 points)**: 
     - The use of `Set_G_acc` instead of `SetGravitationalAcceleration` is incorrect and could lead to different simulation behavior. **(15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors (10 points)**: 
     - The ground is positioned at `-5` on the Y-axis, while the reference script positions it at `-0.5`, which could affect the simulation's dynamics. **(10 points)**
   - **Minor Inaccuracies (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code uses `ChVectorD` while the reference uses `ChVector3d`, which is a minor inconsistency. **(5 points)**

   **Total Deductions for Correctness: 15 + 10 + 5 = 30 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 to 10 points)**: 
     - The code is relatively readable but lacks comments explaining the purpose of various sections, which the reference script provides. **(5 points)**
   - **Insufficient Comments (5 points)**: 
     - There are no comments in the provided code, which makes it less understandable compared to the reference. **(5 points)**

   **Total Deductions for Code Quality: 5 + 5 = 10 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not have any unnecessary calculations, but it lacks optimizations seen in the reference script, such as the handling of camera settings and light configurations. **(5 points)**

   **Total Deductions for Efficiency: 5 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are present in the reference script. **(5 points)**

   **Total Deductions for Error Handling: 5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 to 5 points)**: 
     - The provided code lacks advanced visualization features such as textures, shadows, and logos, which are present in the reference. **(5 points)**

   **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools: 5 points**

### Final Score Calculation
- Total Deductions: 45 (Completeness) + 30 (Correctness) + 10 (Code Quality) + 5 (Efficiency) + 5 (Error Handling) + 5 (Visualization Tools) = 100 points
- Maximum Score: 100 points
- Final Score: 100 - 100 = 0 points

### Final Score Output

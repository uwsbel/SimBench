### Summary of Deductions
- **Completeness**: 0 points
- **Correctness**: 0 points
- **Code Quality**: 0 points
- **Efficiency**: 0 points
- **Error Handling and Robustness**: 5 points
- **Use of Visualization Tools**: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Total deductions: 5 + 3 = 8 points  
Total score: 100 - 8 = 92

### Final Score Output
[[92]] 

### Explanation of Deductions
The script is well-structured and follows best practices for PyChrono simulations. However, it lacks explicit error handling in the ROS manager initialization and simulation loop, which could lead to issues if the ROS system fails to initialize or if there are communication problems. Additionally, while the visualization setup is functional, it could be enhanced with additional visual elements like a skybox for better aesthetics.

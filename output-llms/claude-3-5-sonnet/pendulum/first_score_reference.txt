### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The provided code does not include a visual representation for the ground body, which is present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
     - The reference script includes a logo and a skybox in the visualization, which are absent in the provided code. This results in an additional deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 20 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: 
     - The provided code uses `Set_G_acc` instead of `SetGravitationalAcceleration`, which is the correct method in the reference. This is a significant deviation and results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The pendulum's inertia tensor is set correctly, but the reference script uses a different configuration for the pendulum's properties, which could lead to different simulation behavior. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The provided code is relatively readable, but it lacks some comments that would help clarify the purpose of certain sections. The reference script has better documentation. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The provided code logs the pendulum's position and velocity every 10 steps, which is less efficient than the reference script's approach of logging after a specific time. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the simulation state, which is a basic requirement. The reference script handles potential issues more robustly. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code does not include a logo or skybox, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 20 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 20 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 65 points
- Final Score: 100 - 65 = 35 points

### Final Score Output
[[35]]

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks the gravitational acceleration setting, which is present in the reference script. This is essential for realistic simulations involving gravity. **(-15 points)**
     - The reference script uses a `ChSystemSMC()` for smoother contact dynamics, while the provided code uses `ChSystemNSC()`, which may not be optimal for all scenarios. **(-10 points)**
     - The reference script includes a static linear analysis step (`sys.DoStaticLinear()`), which is missing in the provided code. **(-15 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: **-40 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: 
     - The provided code uses `SetInertiaVx` and `SetInertiaVy`, which are not standard for defining inertia in the context of beams. The reference script correctly sets inertia using `ChInertiaCosseratSimple`. **(-15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The initialization of the motor and its speed function is less flexible than in the reference script, which uses a sine function for varying speed. This could lead to less dynamic behavior in the simulation. **(-10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: **-25 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The provided code is generally readable, but it lacks comments explaining the purpose of various sections, which are present in the reference script. **(-5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: **-5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The provided code does not optimize the creation of the flywheel and beam elements as effectively as the reference script, which uses a builder for the beam. **(-5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: **-5 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the success of operations, which could lead to issues during execution. The reference script includes more robust handling of potential issues. **(-5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: **-5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code does not include a logo or skybox in the visualization setup, which enhances the visual appeal and context of the simulation. The reference script includes these elements. **(-3 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: **-3 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: -40 points
- Correctness: -25 points
- Code Quality: -5 points
- Efficiency: -5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: -5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: -3 points

### Final Score Calculation
The provided code starts with a perfect score of 100 points. After applying the deductions:

- Total Deductions: 40 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 83 points
- Final Score: 100 - 83 = 17 points

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. However, there are some minor deviations:
     - The `SetGravitationalAcceleration` method uses `chrono.ChVectorD` instead of `chrono.ChVector3d`, which is a slight deviation. **(5 points deduction)**
     - The `SetRot` method is used instead of `SetCoordsys` for the flywheel, which is less clear. **(5 points deduction)**
   - Total deductions: **10 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The use of `SetGShearModulus` is replaced with a direct calculation in the provided code, which could lead to inaccuracies. **(15 points deduction)**
   - The `SetSpeedFunction` is used instead of `SetMotorFunction`, which is a significant deviation. **(15 points deduction)**
   - Total deductions: **30 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of certain sections, especially around the creation of the flywheel and the motor. **(5 points deduction)**
   - Total deductions: **5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not show significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, the use of `m.floor(len(...))` could be optimized to `len(...) // 2` for clarity. **(3 points deduction)**
   - Total deductions: **3 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks any explicit error handling or checks that might be present in the reference script. **(5 points deduction)**
   - Total deductions: **5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the use of `SetZbufferHide(False)` is unnecessary and not present in the reference script. **(2 points deduction)**
   - Total deductions: **2 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 10 points
- Correctness: 30 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total deductions: 55 points
- Final score: 100 - 55 = 45

### Final Score

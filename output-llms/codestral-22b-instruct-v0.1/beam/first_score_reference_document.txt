### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks the following essential components present in the reference script:
       - Material properties for the beams (e.g., Young's modulus, shear modulus).
       - Section properties for the beam (e.g., centroid, shear center).
       - Constraints connecting nodes to fixed bodies.
       - Application of forces and torques to nodes.
       - Visualization of beam elements and nodes.
     - **Deductions**: 15 points for each missing essential component (total of 6 components) = **90 points** (exceeds maximum deduction, capped at 40 points).
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: **40 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of PyChrono API**: 
     - The code uses `chrono.ChSystemNSC()` instead of `chrono.ChSystemSMC()`, which is more appropriate for FEA simulations.
     - The beam elements are not properly initialized with a section, which is crucial for defining their properties.
     - **Deductions**: 15 points for incorrect system initialization and 15 points for incorrect beam initialization = **30 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: **30 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The code is relatively well-structured but lacks meaningful comments explaining the purpose of each section.
     - Variable names are somewhat generic (e.g., `my_system`, `mesh`), but they are acceptable.
     - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments and 5 points for minor readability issues = **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **10 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations or Redundant Code**: 
     - The code does not exhibit significant inefficiencies, but it could be optimized by grouping similar property settings for beams.
     - **Deductions**: 3 points for missing optimization opportunities.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **3 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling**: 
     - The code does not include any error handling mechanisms or checks for successful initialization of components.
     - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of error handling.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The visualization setup is minimal and does not include advanced features like adding logos, skyboxes, or specific visual shapes for the beams.
     - **Deductions**: 5 points for inadequate visualization setup.
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: **5 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points
- Correctness: 30 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
- Total Points Deducted: 40 + 30 + 10 + 3 + 5 + 5 = 93 points
- Maximum Score: 100 points
- Final Score: 100 - 93 = 7 points

### Final Score Output

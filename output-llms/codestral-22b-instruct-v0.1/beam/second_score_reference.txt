### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code is missing the explicit creation of nodes and elements for the beam, which is present in the reference script. The reference script creates nodes (`hnode1`, `hnode2`, `hnode3`) and elements (`belement1`, `belement2`) explicitly, while the provided code relies solely on the `ChBuilderBeamEuler` to create the beam. This results in a deduction of **15 points** for missing essential components.
   - The provided code does not include the creation of a fixed body (`mtruss`) and the constraints (`constr_bc`, `constr_d`) for fixing nodes, which are present in the reference script. This results in an additional deduction of **15 points**.
   - Total deductions for completeness: **30 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code uses the `SetForce` method correctly, but the force applied to the first node is `(0, -1, 0)` instead of `(4, 2, 0)` as in the reference script. This is a significant deviation that affects simulation behavior, leading to a deduction of **15 points**.
   - The provided code does not apply a torque to the third node, which is present in the reference script. This is another significant deviation, leading to an additional deduction of **15 points**.
   - Total deductions for correctness: **30 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The provided code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks some comments that would help clarify the purpose of certain sections. The reference script includes more detailed comments, which enhance understanding. This results in a deduction of **5 points** for insufficient comments.
   - Total deductions for code quality: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not have any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, it could have included the creation of nodes and elements directly instead of relying solely on the builder, which is a more efficient approach in the reference script. This results in a minor deduction of **3 points** for missing optimization opportunities.
   - Total deductions for efficiency: **3 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling or robustness checks, which are not explicitly present in the reference script either. However, the reference script does demonstrate a more robust approach by using constraints to fix nodes. This results in a deduction of **5 points** for lack of basic error handling.
   - Total deductions for error handling and robustness: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup in the provided code is similar to that in the reference script, but it lacks some details regarding the visualization of nodes and elements. The reference script includes explicit comments and a more structured approach to visualization. This results in a deduction of **3 points** for inadequate visualization setup.
   - Total deductions for visualization tools: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: **30 points**
- Correctness: **30 points**
- Code Quality: **5 points**
- Efficiency: **3 points**
- Error Handling and Robustness: **5 points**
- Use of Visualization Tools: **3 points**

### Final Score Calculation
The total deductions amount to **106 points**. Since the maximum score is 100 points, the final score is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Final Score} = 100 - 106 = -6 \]

Since scores cannot be negative, the final score is capped at **0**.

### Final Score Output

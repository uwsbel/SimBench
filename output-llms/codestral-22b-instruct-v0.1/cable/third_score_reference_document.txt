### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: The provided code is mostly complete, but it lacks the creation of visual shapes for the hinge and the box bodies, which are present in the reference code. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Minor Omissions**: The `PrintBodyPositions` method in the provided code uses `print(f"End body {i+1} position: {body.GetPos()}")`, which is slightly less informative than the reference's `print("  " << body.GetPos())`. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 + 5 = **20 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The provided code initializes the `ChLinkLockLock` constraint without the necessary direction constraints that are present in the reference code. This could lead to significant differences in simulation behavior, resulting in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: The force applied to the beam's end node is significantly higher in the provided code (`chrono.ChVector3d(0, -0.7, 0)`) compared to the reference (`chrono.ChVector3d(0, -0.2, 0)`), which could lead to different dynamics. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 + 10 = **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code is well-structured and readable, but it could benefit from more comments explaining the purpose of certain sections, especially around the constraints and body creation. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Redundant Code**: The provided code has some redundancy in the way it initializes constraints and bodies, which could be streamlined. However, it does not have any major inefficiencies compared to the reference. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the successful creation of bodies or constraints, which is a basic requirement for robustness. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the absence of visual shapes for the hinge and box bodies leads to a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 20 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
- Total Points Deducted: 20 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = **63 points**
- Starting Score: 100 points
- Final Score: 100 - 63 = **37 points**

### Final Score Output

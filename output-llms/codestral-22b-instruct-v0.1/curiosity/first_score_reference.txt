### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code lacks the following essential components present in the reference script:
       - Collision system setup (`system.SetCollisionSystemType(...)`).
       - Gravitational acceleration setup (`system.SetGravitationalAcceleration(...)`).
       - Contact material for the ground body.
       - Initialization of a rover or similar body.
       - Texture application for the ground body.
       - The ground body is not fixed in place.
     - Total deductions: 6 components x 15 points = **90 points** (exceeds maximum, capped at 40 points).
   - **Lack of Important Details (10 points)**: The ground body is not fixed, which is a significant detail in the reference.
   - **Minor Omissions (5 points)**: The visualization setup is less detailed compared to the reference.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: **40 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API (15 points)**: The absence of collision system and gravitational settings could lead to significant differences in simulation behavior.
   - **Logical Errors (10 points)**: The ground body is not fixed, which could lead to incorrect simulation results.
   - **Minor Inaccuracies (5 points)**: The simulation loop lacks time step management and rover dynamics.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: **30 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5-10 points)**: The code is relatively straightforward but lacks comments and meaningful variable names compared to the reference.
   - **Insufficient Comments (5 points)**: The provided code lacks comments explaining the purpose of various sections.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **10 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations (5 points)**: The simulation loop could be optimized for performance, but no significant inefficiencies are present.
   - **Missing Optimization Opportunities (3 points)**: The reference script uses a more structured approach to the simulation loop.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **8 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling (5 points)**: The provided code does not account for potential issues that could arise during simulation.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup (3-5 points)**: The visualization setup is minimal compared to the reference, lacking features like shadows and textures.
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: **5 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points
- Correctness: 30 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 8 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
- Total Deductions: 40 + 30 + 10 + 8 + 5 + 5 = 98 points
- Maximum Score: 100 points
- Final Score: 100 - 98 = 2 points

### Final Score Output

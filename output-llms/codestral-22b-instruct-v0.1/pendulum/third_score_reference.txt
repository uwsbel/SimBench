### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, visualization, and simulation loop. However, there is a minor deviation in the initialization of the second pendulum's joint. The reference script uses a different position for the revolute joint initialization (`chrono.ChVector3d(2, 0, 1)` instead of `chrono.ChVector3d(2, 0, 0)`). This is a significant detail that affects the simulation's behavior.
   - **Deductions: 10 points** for incorrect joint initialization.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code correctly uses the PyChrono API for most parts. However, the time step in the simulation loop is set to `1e-3` in the provided code, while the reference script uses `1e-2`. This could lead to a significant difference in simulation behavior, as a smaller time step could affect the accuracy and performance of the simulation.
   - **Deductions: 15 points** for incorrect use of the time step in the simulation loop.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable. Variable names are meaningful, and comments are present to explain the code. However, the comments could be more detailed in some areas, particularly regarding the purpose of certain parameters in the joint initialization.
   - **Deductions: 5 points** for insufficient comments.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit any unnecessary calculations or redundant code. However, the time step could be optimized for better performance, as the reference script uses a larger time step which may be more efficient for this type of simulation.
   - **Deductions: 3 points** for missing obvious optimization opportunities.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which could be important for robustness, especially in a simulation context where various issues may arise.
   - **Deductions: 5 points** for lack of basic error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the window title in the provided code is "Double Pendulum demo," while the reference script uses "Double Pendulum Simulation." This is a minor issue but reflects a lack of attention to detail.
   - **Deductions: 2 points** for minor visualization issues.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 10 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- 100 - (10 + 15 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 2) = 60

### Final Score

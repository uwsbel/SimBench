### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. However, the custom motor function is defined after its usage, which could lead to confusion. This is a minor deviation.
   - **Deductions:** 5 points for the order of definition of the custom motor function.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The custom motor function `ChFunctionMyFun` is defined differently in the provided code compared to the reference. The reference uses a ramp function for motor speed, while the provided code uses a sinusoidal function. This could lead to significant differences in simulation behavior.
   - Additionally, the parameters for the motor function in the provided code do not match the reference, which could lead to incorrect motor behavior.
   - **Deductions:** 15 points for incorrect use of the motor function and 10 points for logical errors in the motor initialization.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of certain sections, particularly around the custom motor function and its parameters.
   - **Deductions:** 5 points for insufficient comments.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - There are no significant inefficiencies in the code compared to the reference. However, the use of `m.floor` could be replaced with integer division for clarity, but this is a minor point.
   - **Deductions:** 3 points for minor optimization opportunities.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which could be important for robustness, especially in a simulation context.
   - **Deductions:** 5 points for lack of error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the order of adding visual shapes could be improved for clarity. There are no major issues, but the setup could be more organized.
   - **Deductions:** 3 points for minor visualization issues.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 5 + 25 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 3 = 46
- Final Score: 100 - 46 = 54

### Final Score Output
[[54]]

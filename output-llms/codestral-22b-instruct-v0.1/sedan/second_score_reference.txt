### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code initializes two vehicles but does not create a driver system for each vehicle as done in the reference script. Instead, it uses `ChInteractiveDriverIRR` for both vehicles, which is not the same as the `ChDriver` used in the reference. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Incorrect Configuration (10 points)**: 
     - The second vehicle is initialized with a different method than the reference script. The reference script creates the second vehicle using the existing system from the first vehicle, while the provided code initializes it separately. This is a significant deviation, leading to a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Minor Omissions (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not include the output for the mass of the second vehicle, which is present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Completeness: 30 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API (15 points)**: 
     - The provided code uses `ChInteractiveDriverIRR` instead of `ChDriver`, which could lead to significant differences in how driver inputs are processed. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors (10 points)**: 
     - The sinusoidal steering input is applied to both vehicles in the same manner, which is not the case in the reference script where different steering inputs are set. This leads to a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Minor Inaccuracies (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code has some unnecessary API calls, such as setting the visualization type for each vehicle multiple times, which is not optimized as in the reference. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Correctness: 30 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 points)**: 
     - The code is generally readable, but the structure could be improved by grouping related initializations together. This leads to a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Comments and Documentation (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of certain sections, especially in the simulation loop. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Code Quality: 10 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code has redundant calls to set visualization types for each vehicle, which could be optimized. This leads to a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Missing Optimization Opportunities (3 points)**: 
     - The way driver inputs are handled could be optimized, as the reference script demonstrates a more efficient approach. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Efficiency: 8 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which could lead to issues during runtime. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not set up the second vehicle's visualization as effectively as the reference script, leading to a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Minor Visualization Issues (2 points)**: 
     - There are minor issues with lighting and scene setup compared to the reference script, resulting in a deduction of **2 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points**

### Final Score Calculation
- **Total Points Deducted**: 30 (Completeness) + 30 (Correctness) + 10 (Code Quality) + 8 (Efficiency) + 5 (Error Handling) + 5 (Visualization) = 88 points deducted
- **Final Score**: 100 - 88 = 12

### Final Score Output

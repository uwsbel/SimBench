### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components (15 points each)**: The provided code lacks the creation of additional sensors and the setup of multiple point lights in the visualization, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points** for each missing essential component. Total: **30 points**.
   - **Minor Omissions (5 points)**: The provided code does not include the initialization of the sensor manager in the same way as the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**. 
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: **35 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API (15 points)**: The provided code does not utilize the sensor manager correctly as it lacks the setup for multiple point lights and does not create a second camera sensor. This could lead to a significant change in simulation behavior. Total: **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors (10 points)**: There are no significant logical errors in the provided code compared to the reference script. Total: **0 points**.
   - **Minor Inaccuracies (5 points)**: There are no minor inaccuracies present. Total: **0 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: **15 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 to 10 points)**: The provided code is generally well-structured and readable, similar to the reference script. However, it could benefit from more comments explaining the purpose of certain sections. Deduct **5 points** for insufficient comments. 
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations or Redundant Code (5 points)**: The provided code does not exhibit any unnecessary calculations or redundant code compared to the reference script. Total: **0 points**.
   - **Missing Optimization Opportunities (3 points)**: There are no obvious optimization opportunities that the reference script implements that are missing in the provided code. Total: **0 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **0 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling (5 points)**: The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**. 
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Incorrect or Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 to 5 points)**: The provided code does not set up multiple point lights and lacks the additional camera sensor, which affects the visualization quality. Deduct **5 points** for inadequate visualization setup. 
   - **Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools**: **5 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: **35 points**
- Correctness: **15 points**
- Code Quality: **5 points**
- Efficiency: **0 points**
- Error Handling and Robustness: **5 points**
- Use of Visualization Tools: **5 points**

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 35 + 15 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 5 = **65 points**
- Final Score: 100 - 65 = **35 points**

### Final Score Output
[[35]]

### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code is missing the initialization of the SCM terrain parameters that are present in the reference script. Specifically, the reference script sets soil parameters using `terrain.SetSoilParameters(...)`, which is absent in the provided code. This results in a **15-point deduction**.
   - The terrain initialization in the reference script includes specific parameters for mesh resolution and initial mesh grid, which are not present in the provided code. This leads to an additional **15-point deduction**.
   - Total deductions for completeness: **30 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code uses `veh.SCMDeformableTerrain` instead of the `veh.SCMTerrain` as in the reference script. This could lead to significant differences in simulation behavior, resulting in a **15-point deduction**.
   - The terrain height is set to a constant value in the reference script, while the provided code uses a height map. This could lead to logical errors in terrain interaction, resulting in another **10-point deduction**.
   - Total deductions for correctness: **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks comments explaining the purpose of certain sections, particularly around the terrain setup and vehicle initialization. This results in a **5-point deduction**.
   - Total deductions for code quality: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code has some unnecessary calculations, such as the hard-coded throttle value being set every simulation step instead of being handled more efficiently. This results in a **5-point deduction**.
   - Total deductions for efficiency: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, such as checking if the terrain file exists or if the vehicle initializes correctly. This results in a **5-point deduction**.
   - Total deductions for error handling and robustness: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the provided code does not include the setup for the terrain visualization type, which is present in the reference script. This results in a **3-point deduction**.
   - Total deductions for visualization tools: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting with a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total deductions: 30 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 73 points
- Final score: 100 - 73 = 27 points

### Final Score Output

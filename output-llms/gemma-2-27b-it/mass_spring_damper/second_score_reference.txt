### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. However, there are slight deviations in the naming conventions and structure of the force functor.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - **5 points** for minor deviations in the naming of the `Evaluate` method (should be `evaluate` as per Python conventions).
     - **5 points** for the custom force functor not following the same structure as the reference (missing parameters like `time`, `length`, and `vel`).
   - **Total Deductions**: 10 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The use of the `ChLinkForce` in the provided code is incorrect. The reference uses `ChLinkTSDA` for both springs, which is more appropriate for spring-damper systems.
   - The calculation of the spring force in the custom functor is also incorrect; it does not account for the difference in length from the rest length.
   - **Deductions**:
     - **15 points** for incorrect use of `ChLinkForce` instead of `ChLinkTSDA`.
     - **10 points** for logical errors in the custom force calculation.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally readable, but the comments are less informative compared to the reference. The variable names are mostly clear, but the structure could be improved.
   - **Deductions**:
     - **5 points** for insufficient comments and documentation compared to the reference.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not have significant inefficiencies, but the custom force calculation could be optimized to avoid repeated calculations.
   - **Deductions**:
     - **3 points** for missing optimization opportunities in the force calculation.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks any error handling mechanisms, which could lead to issues during execution.
   - **Deductions**:
     - **5 points** for lack of basic error handling.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor issues with the visualization of the spring.
   - **Deductions**:
     - **3 points** for inadequate visualization setup (e.g., using `ChLinkForce` instead of `ChLinkTSDA`).
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 10 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 51 points
- Final Score: 100 - 51 = 49

### Final Score Output

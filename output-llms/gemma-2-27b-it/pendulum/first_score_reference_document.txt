### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The reference script includes a fixed ground body and a visual shape for it, while the provided code uses `ChBodyEasyBox` without fixing it or adding a visual shape. **(15 points deduction)**
     - The reference script initializes the pendulum with inertia properties, which is missing in the provided code. **(15 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: 
     - The provided code uses `chrono.ChLinkRevolute()` instead of `chrono.ChLinkLockRevolute()`, which is a significant deviation as it affects the joint behavior. **(15 points deduction)**
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The pendulum bob's inertia is not set, which could lead to incorrect dynamics. **(10 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The provided code is generally readable, but variable names like `bob` and `ground` could be more descriptive. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Comments**: 
     - The provided code has some comments, but they are not as detailed as in the reference script. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 10 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The provided code does not have significant inefficiencies, but it could benefit from better structuring of the simulation loop. **(3 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for potential issues during simulation. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code lacks some visual enhancements present in the reference script, such as adding a logo and typical lights. **(3 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 25 + 10 + 3 + 5 + 3 = 76 points
- Final Score: 100 - 76 = 24

### Final Score Output

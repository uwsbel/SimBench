### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components:** 
     - The provided code is missing the initialization of the third node (`hnode4`) and the corresponding beam element that connects it to the previous node. This is a significant omission as it affects the structure of the beam system.
     - The reference code also includes a second beam created using the last node from the previous beam, which is not present in the provided code. 
     - **Deductions:** 15 points for each missing essential component (2 components) = **30 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API:** 
     - The provided code uses `hnode3.SetTorque(chrono.ChVector3d(0, -0.04, 0))`, which is not present in the reference code. While this may not be incorrect per se, it introduces a difference in behavior that is not justified by the reference.
     - **Deductions:** 10 points for logical errors in the code (unjustified torque application) = **10 points**.
   - **Minor inaccuracies:** The force applied to `hnode2` is different in magnitude and direction compared to the reference code. 
     - **Deductions:** 5 points for minor inaccuracies = **5 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks some comments that would clarify the purpose of certain sections, especially around the force and torque applications.
   - **Deductions:** 5 points for insufficient comments = **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not exhibit any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, the redundant creation of nodes and elements could be optimized by using the builder more effectively.
   - **Deductions:** 3 points for missing obvious optimization opportunities = **3 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the successful creation of nodes and elements, which could lead to runtime errors if any part of the code fails.
   - **Deductions:** 5 points for lack of basic error handling = **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the provided code does not include the same level of detail in visualizing the nodes and elements as the reference code.
   - **Deductions:** 3 points for inadequate visualization setup = **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from 100 points:
- 100 - (30 + 15 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 3) = 39 points

### Final Score

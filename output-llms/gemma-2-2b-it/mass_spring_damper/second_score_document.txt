### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

#### Completeness (40 points total)
1. **System Initialization**: The system is initialized correctly with `chrono.ChSystemNSC()`, and gravitational acceleration is set. **(0 points deducted)**
2. **Body Creation**: Both bodies (body_1 and body_2) are created and added to the system, and their properties are set correctly. **(0 points deducted)**
3. **Visualization Setup**: The visualization system is set up properly with a window size, title, and camera. **(0 points deducted)**
4. **Spring and Damping Setup**: Springs are created between the bodies and ground, and a custom force functor is used for one of the springs. **(0 points deducted)**
5. **Missing Essential Components**: There are no missing essential components. **(0 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Completeness: 0 points**

#### Correctness (30 points total)
1. **Incorrect Use of API**: The custom force calculation in `MySpringForce` is incorrect. The force should depend on the relative displacement, not just the relative position. **(15 points deducted)**
2. **Logical Errors**: The spring initialization for `spring_2` is correct, but the force calculation logic is flawed. **(10 points deducted)**
3. **Minor Inaccuracies**: No minor inaccuracies were observed. **(0 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Correctness: 25 points**

#### Code Quality (10 points total)
1. **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. **(0 points deducted)**
2. **Comments**: There are insufficient comments explaining the purpose of various sections of the code. **(5 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Code Quality: 5 points**

#### Efficiency (10 points total)
1. **Unnecessary Calculations**: There are no unnecessary calculations or redundant code. **(0 points deducted)**
2. **Optimization Opportunities**: The force calculation could be optimized by directly using the relative displacement instead of recalculating it. **(3 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Efficiency: 3 points**

#### Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)
1. **Basic Error Handling**: There is no error handling in the code, which is important for robustness. **(5 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points**

#### Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)
1. **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is adequate, but there could be improvements in lighting and visual elements. **(3 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points**

### Final Score Calculation
- **Total Points Deducted**: 0 (Completeness) + 25 (Correctness) + 5 (Code Quality) + 3 (Efficiency) + 5 (Error Handling) + 3 (Visualization) = 41 points deducted
- **Final Score**: 100 - 41 = 59

### Final Score Output
[[59]] 

### Summary of Deductions
- **Correctness**: Significant issues with the force calculation logic.
- **Code Quality**: Lack of comments.
- **Efficiency**: Minor optimization opportunities.
- **Error Handling**: No error handling present.
- **Visualization**: Adequate but could be improved.

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks several components present in the reference script:
     - The output directory is set to "BEAM_FAILED" instead of "BEAM_BUCKLING" (5 points).
     - The crank body position is set incorrectly; it should be `(vB + vG) * 0.5` instead of `(vC + vG) * 0.5` (10 points).
     - The motor type is `ChLinkMotorRotationSpeed` instead of `ChLinkMotorRotationAngle` (10 points).
     - The number of elements in the IGA beam is set to 30 instead of 32 (5 points).
     - The vertical beam's section properties are not aligned with the reference (5 points).
     - The final simulation loop and visualization setup are missing (15 points).
   - **Total Deductions**: 50 points (15 points for missing essential components).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: The motor is set to a speed function instead of an angle function, which could lead to significant differences in simulation behavior (15 points).
   - **Logical Errors**: The initialization of the crank body and the constraints between beams are not correctly set up compared to the reference (10 points).
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points (15 points for incorrect API usage, 10 points for logical errors).

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally readable, but the comments could be more descriptive, especially regarding the purpose of certain sections (5 points).
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Redundant Code**: There are instances of unnecessary calculations or settings that could be optimized, such as the repeated setting of properties that could be combined (5 points).
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The code does not include any error handling or checks for potential issues that could arise during execution (5 points).
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is incomplete compared to the reference script, lacking elements such as camera setup, lighting, and grid drawing (5 points).
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 50 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
- **Total Points Deducted**: 50 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 95 points
- **Final Score**: 100 - 95 = 5 points

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. However, it lacks the explicit mention of using a more precise HHT timestepper, which is present in the reference script. 
   - **Deduction**: 5 points for minor omission.
   - **Total**: 35 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code has a significant error in the custom motor function. The reference script uses a different approach to define the motor speed function, which is more complex and likely to yield different results. 
   - Additionally, the `CH_PI` constant is defined as `3.1456`, which is not accurate (it should be `3.141592653589793`).
   - **Deduction**: 15 points for incorrect use of the API (motor function), and 15 points for the incorrect value of `CH_PI`.
   - **Total**: 0 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks some comments that would help clarify the purpose of certain sections, especially around the custom motor function and the visualization setup.
   - **Deduction**: 5 points for insufficient comments.
   - **Total**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not exhibit any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, there are minor opportunities for optimization, such as the way the motor function is defined.
   - **Deduction**: 3 points for missing obvious optimization opportunities.
   - **Total**: 7 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are crucial for robustness, especially in simulations that can encounter various runtime issues.
   - **Deduction**: 5 points for lack of basic error handling.
   - **Total**: 0 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but it lacks the explicit mention of setting a more precise timestepper, which is a part of the reference script.
   - **Deduction**: 3 points for inadequate visualization setup.
   - **Total**: 2 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 30 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
- Total Points: 100
- Deductions: 5 + 30 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 3 = 51
- Final Score: 100 - 51 = 49

### Final Score Output

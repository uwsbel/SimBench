### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. However, the `move` function is defined outside the simulation loop, which can lead to confusion about its scope and usage. This is a minor deviation from the reference script where the function is defined before its usage.
   - **Deduction**: 5 points for the minor deviation in function placement.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The robot's motor speeds in the `move` function are set to different values compared to the reference script. The reference uses `-math.pi` for both wheels when moving straight, while the provided code uses `0.5`. This could lead to a significant change in the robot's behavior.
   - **Deduction**: 15 points for incorrect use of motor speed settings.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable. However, there are some comments that could be improved for clarity, especially around the `move` function. The function lacks a docstring explaining its purpose and parameters.
   - **Deduction**: 5 points for insufficient comments/documentation.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not contain any unnecessary calculations or redundant code. However, the `move` function could be optimized by avoiding repeated calls to `robot.SetMotorSpeed` for the same wheel in different conditions.
   - **Deduction**: 3 points for missing optimization opportunities.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code includes error handling for the `move` function, which is good. However, it does not account for potential issues in the simulation loop, such as checking if the visualization system is still running before proceeding.
   - **Deduction**: 3 points for inadequate handling of edge cases.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the shadows are enabled without checking if the rendering supports it, which could lead to performance issues on some systems.
   - **Deduction**: 3 points for minor visualization issues.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 3 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 34 points
- Final Score: 100 - 34 = 66

### Final Score

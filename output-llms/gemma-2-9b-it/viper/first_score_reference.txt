### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code lacks the collision system setup (`system.SetCollisionSystemType(...)`) and the collision model parameters (`chrono.ChCollisionModel.SetDefaultSuggestedEnvelope(...)` and `chrono.ChCollisionModel.SetDefaultSuggestedMargin(...)`). This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
     - The ground body in the reference script includes a material setup (`ground_mat`) and texture assignment, which are missing in the provided code. This results in another deduction of **15 points**.
     - The Viper rover is instantiated using a specific class (`viper.Viper`) in the reference script, while the provided code uses a generic cylinder. This results in another deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: **45 points** (over the maximum of 40, capped at 40).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code uses `chrono.ChDriverEasy`, which is not a standard class in the context of the Viper rover. The reference script uses `viper.ViperDCMotorControl`, which is more appropriate. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors (10 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not initialize the rover correctly, which could lead to significant differences in simulation behavior. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 to 10 points)**: 
     - The provided code is relatively straightforward but lacks meaningful comments and structure compared to the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Insufficient Comments (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code has minimal comments explaining the purpose of various sections, which is less informative than the reference script. This results in another deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **10 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code calculates the steering angle in a way that could be optimized. The reference script has a more efficient approach to steering behavior. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for common issues, which the reference script addresses. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 to 5 points)**: 
     - The provided code has a basic visualization setup but lacks the advanced features (like shadows, logo, and skybox) present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: **5 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 40 + 25 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 90 points
- Final Score: 100 - 90 = 10 points

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks collision system setup (`system.SetCollisionSystemType(...)`) and contact material configuration, which are present in the reference script. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - The ground body in the reference script has a texture applied for visualization, which is missing in the provided code. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The provided code uses `chrono.Set_G_acc(...)` instead of `system.SetGravitationalAcceleration(...)`, which is the correct method according to the reference. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The provided code does not initialize the rover properly as it uses `chrono.ChBodyEasyCylinder(...)` instead of the more appropriate `viper.Viper(...)` from the reference. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The code is generally readable, but lacks meaningful comments and documentation compared to the reference. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The provided code calculates the steering angle in a way that is less efficient than the reference, which uses a more structured approach to control the steering over time. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or robustness checks, which are present in the reference. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code does not set up lighting and other visual elements as comprehensively as the reference script. **(Deduct 3 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
- **Total Points Deducted**: 25 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 68 points
- **Final Score**: 100 - 68 = 32 points

### Final Score Output
[[32]]

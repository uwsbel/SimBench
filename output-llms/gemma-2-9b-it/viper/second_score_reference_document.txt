### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code includes all essential components found in the reference script, such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. Therefore, no points are deducted here.
   - **Minor Omissions**: There are no significant omissions or deviations from the reference script. Thus, no points are deducted.

   **Score: 40/40**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: The provided code uses the PyChrono API correctly without any significant errors that would alter the simulation behavior. Therefore, no points are deducted.
   - **Logical Errors**: There are no logical errors present in the code. The initialization and updates are consistent with the reference script.
   - **Minor Inaccuracies**: There are no minor inaccuracies or unnecessary API calls that deviate from the reference script.

   **Score: 30/30**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is well-structured and readable, following a logical flow similar to the reference script. However, there are some areas where comments could be more descriptive, particularly around the simulation loop and sensor setup.
   - **Comments**: The code includes comments, but they could be more detailed to enhance understanding.

   **Deductions**: -5 points for insufficient comments.

   **Score: 5/10**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The code does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It efficiently updates the simulation and renders the scene.
   - **Optimization Opportunities**: There are no obvious optimization opportunities missed compared to the reference script.

   **Score: 10/10**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Basic Error Handling**: The provided code lacks explicit error handling mechanisms, such as checks for successful initialization of the visualization system or sensor manager.
   - **Edge Cases**: There are no provisions for handling edge cases, such as what happens if the visualization fails to run.

   **Deductions**: -5 points for lack of basic error handling.

   **Score: 0/5**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct and mirrors the reference script. However, the commented-out line for enabling shadows could be considered a minor issue, as it might improve the visual quality if uncommented.
   - **Minor Visualization Issues**: The lighting setup is adequate, but there is a missed opportunity to enable shadows for better realism.

   **Deductions**: -3 points for the commented-out shadow feature.

   **Score: 2/5**

### Final Score Calculation
- Completeness: 40/40
- Correctness: 30/30
- Code Quality: 5/10
- Efficiency: 10/10
- Error Handling and Robustness: 0/5
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2/5

**Total Score**: 40 + 30 + 5 + 10 + 0 + 2 = **87/100**

### Final Score Output

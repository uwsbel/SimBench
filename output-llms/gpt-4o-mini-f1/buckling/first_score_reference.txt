### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks the creation of a crank body and the associated constraints that are present in the reference script. This is a significant omission as it affects the overall functionality of the simulation. **(15 points deduction)**
     - The reference script uses a Pardiso solver for better performance, which is not included in the provided code. **(15 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The provided code uses `ChLinkMotorRotationTorque` instead of `ChLinkMotorRotationAngle`, which is more appropriate for the intended functionality of applying a torque based on an angle. This could lead to significant changes in simulation behavior. **(15 points deduction)**
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The provided code initializes a motor with a custom function that applies a torque, but the logic of the motor function is not aligned with the reference's approach. The reference uses a function that defines an angle based on input, which is more suitable for the context. **(10 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The provided code is relatively well-structured, but it lacks meaningful comments and documentation compared to the reference script. The reference script has clearer variable names and better organization. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The provided code includes some redundant calculations, such as the repeated creation of nodes and elements without leveraging functions or loops for efficiency. The reference script optimizes this through the use of builders. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms or checks for common issues, which the reference script addresses. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code does not include the same level of detail in visualization as the reference script, particularly in terms of visual shapes and their configurations. **(3 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a full score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 73 points
- Final Score: 100 - 73 = 27 points

### Final Score Output

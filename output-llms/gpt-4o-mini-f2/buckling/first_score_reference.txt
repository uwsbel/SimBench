### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks several components that are present in the reference script:
     - The reference script includes a custom function for motor angles, which is absent in the provided code. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - The reference script has a detailed setup for the FEM mesh and various beam sections, which are not fully replicated in the provided code. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - The reference script includes specific constraints and visual shapes for the constraints, which are not present in the provided code. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 45 points (exceeds the maximum, capped at 40 points).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The provided code uses `chrono.ChForceTorqueBody` incorrectly for applying forces, which is not the standard way to apply forces in PyChrono. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors**: The constraints between bodies are not set up correctly in the provided code compared to the reference script. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code lacks meaningful variable names and is less structured compared to the reference script. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Comments**: The provided code has insufficient comments explaining the purpose of various sections, especially compared to the reference script. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: 10 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The provided code has redundant calls and lacks optimizations found in the reference script, such as the use of specific solvers and timestepper settings. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Missing Optimization Opportunities**: The provided code does not utilize the Pardiso solver, which is more efficient for stiff systems. **(Deduct 3 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: 8 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are present in the reference script. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The provided code does not set up the visualization of FEM elements as comprehensively as the reference script. **(Deduct 3 points)**
   - **Minor Visualization Issues**: The lighting and camera setup in the provided code are less optimal compared to the reference script. **(Deduct 2 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: 5 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 8 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from 100 points:
- Deductions: 40 + 25 + 10 + 8 + 5 + 5 = 93 points
- Final Score: 100 - 93 = 7 points

### Final Score

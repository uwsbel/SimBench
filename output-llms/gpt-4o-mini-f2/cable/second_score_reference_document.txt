### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script. There are no missing components, and everything is configured correctly. **Score: 0 points deducted.**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The script correctly uses the PyChrono API, and there are no significant errors in the implementation. The use of the `ChBuilderCableANCF`, force application, and hinge constraint initialization are all accurate. **Score: 0 points deducted.**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is well-structured, and the comments are sufficient to understand the purpose of each section. However, there could be minor improvements in variable naming for clarity. **Score: 5 points deducted for minor readability issues.**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It efficiently uses the PyChrono API as per the reference script. **Score: 0 points deducted.**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The script does not include any error handling mechanisms, which could be important for robustness. The reference script does not explicitly handle errors either, but it could be improved. **Score: 5 points deducted for lack of error handling.**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is consistent with the reference script, and all necessary visual elements are included. There are no significant issues. **Score: 0 points deducted.**

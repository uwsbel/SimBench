### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script, such as system initialization, body creation, visualization, and the simulation loop. There are no missing components.
   - **Score Deduction:** 0 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly uses the PyChrono API for creating bodies, joints, and constraints. However, there is a minor issue with the `SetTransmissionRatio` method where the reference script uses `radA / radB` and `radB / radC`, which is correctly reflected in the provided code. 
   - There are no significant logical errors or incorrect configurations that would lead to a significant change in simulation behavior.
   - **Score Deduction:** 0 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names and consistent formatting. The comments are clear and informative, matching the level of documentation in the reference script.
   - **Score Deduction:** 0 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows the same efficient structure as the reference script.
   - **Score Deduction:** 0 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include explicit error handling, which is a common practice in robust code. However, it does not seem to introduce any critical issues that would affect the simulation.
   - **Score Deduction:** 3 points (for lack of basic error handling)

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup in the provided code is consistent with the reference script, including the addition of a logo, skybox, and camera settings. There are no significant issues in the visualization setup.
   - **Score Deduction:** 0 points

### Summary of Deductions
- **Completeness:** 0 points
- **Correctness:** 0 points
- **Code Quality:** 0 points
- **Efficiency:** 0 points
- **Error Handling and Robustness:** 3 points
- **Use of Visualization Tools:** 0 points

### Final Score
The total deductions amount to 3 points, resulting in a final score of 47 out of 50.

**Final Score:** [[47]]

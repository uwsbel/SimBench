### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

#### 1. Completeness (40 points total)
- **Missing Components**: The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script. No major components are missing.
- **Configuration Details**: The configurations for bodies, joints, and links are present and correctly initialized.
- **Minor Omissions**: There are no significant omissions or deviations from the reference script.

**Score Deduction**: 0 points

#### 2. Correctness (30 points total)
- **Incorrect API Usage**: The code uses the PyChrono API correctly without any significant errors that would alter the simulation behavior.
- **Logical Errors**: There are no logical errors in the initialization of joints or body properties.
- **Minor Inaccuracies**: There are no minor inaccuracies or unnecessary API calls that deviate from the reference script.

**Score Deduction**: 0 points

#### 3. Code Quality (10 points total)
- **Readability and Structure**: The code is well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names and consistent formatting.
- **Comments**: The comments are adequate and provide a clear understanding of the code's functionality, similar to the reference script.

**Score Deduction**: 0 points

#### 4. Efficiency (10 points total)
- **Unnecessary Calculations**: The code does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code.
- **Optimization Opportunities**: There are no obvious optimization opportunities missed compared to the reference script.

**Score Deduction**: 0 points

#### 5. Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)
- **Basic Error Handling**: The code does not include explicit error handling mechanisms, which could be considered a minor oversight.
- **Edge Cases**: There is no evident handling of edge cases, but this is not explicitly required in the reference script.

**Score Deduction**: 3 points

#### 6. Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)
- **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is complete and mirrors the reference script effectively.
- **Minor Issues**: There are no significant issues with the visualization setup, but the code could benefit from additional comments explaining the visualization choices.

**Score Deduction**: 0 points

### Evaluation of the Provided Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, visualization, and particle emission. Therefore, no points are deducted in this category.
   - **Score: 40/40**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly uses the PyChrono API for creating bodies, setting properties, and calculating energies. There are no significant errors in the use of the API that would lead to a change in simulation behavior.
   - However, the gravitational constant is hardcoded as `6.674e-3`, which is a modified value. While this is not necessarily incorrect, it may lead to confusion if not documented properly. A deduction of **5 points** is warranted for this minor inaccuracy.
   - **Score: 25/30**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. However, there is a lack of comments explaining the purpose of certain sections, particularly around the energy calculations and the emitter setup. This could be improved for better understanding.
   - A deduction of **5 points** is applied for insufficient comments.
   - **Score: 5/10**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code performs necessary calculations efficiently, but there are some redundant calculations, particularly in the energy calculations where the forces are recalculated after the potential energy is computed. This could be optimized by combining these calculations.
   - A deduction of **5 points** is applied for unnecessary calculations.
   - **Score: 5/10**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks any error handling or checks for potential issues, such as division by zero when calculating potential energy. The reference script does not explicitly handle this either, but it is a common practice to include such checks.
   - A deduction of **5 points** is applied for the lack of basic error handling.
   - **Score: 0/5**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is largely consistent with the reference script, including the addition of a logo, skybox, and camera settings. There are no significant issues with the visualization tools used.
   - **Score: 5/5**

### Final Score Calculation
- Completeness: 40/40
- Correctness: 25/30
- Code Quality: 5/10
- Efficiency: 5/10
- Error Handling and Robustness: 0/5
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5/5

**Total Score: 40 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 0 + 5 = 80**

### Final Score Output

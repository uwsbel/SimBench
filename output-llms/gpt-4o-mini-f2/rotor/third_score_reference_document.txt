### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: The provided code is mostly complete, but there are minor differences in the initialization and configuration of certain components compared to the reference script. For example, the reference script uses semicolons at the end of some lines, which is not present in the provided code. This is a minor deviation, so I will deduct **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The provided code uses `CH_PI = 3.1456`, which is an inaccurate representation of Ï€. The reference script does not define this constant, implying that it uses the built-in `math.pi`, which is more accurate. This is a significant error, so I will deduct **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: There are no significant logical errors in the provided code compared to the reference.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code is well-structured and readable, similar to the reference script. However, the comments could be more detailed in some areas. I will deduct **5 points** for insufficient comments.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The provided code does not exhibit any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, the use of `m.floor(builder.GetLastBeamNodes().size() / 2.0)` could be simplified by directly using integer division. I will deduct **3 points** for this minor inefficiency.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which could be beneficial for robustness. The reference script does not explicitly handle errors either, but it is generally a good practice to include basic error handling. I will deduct **5 points** for this lack of robustness.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup in the provided code is adequate and closely follows the reference script. There are no significant issues, so I will not deduct any points here.
   - **Total Deductions**: 0 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 0 points

### Final Score Calculation
The total deductions amount to **33 points** from a maximum of **100 points**. Therefore, the final score is:

**Final Score**: 100 - 33 = 67

**Final Score Output**: [[67]]

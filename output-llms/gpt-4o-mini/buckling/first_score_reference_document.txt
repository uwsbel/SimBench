### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks several components that are present in the reference script. For instance, it does not include a custom function for motor control, which is a significant part of the reference code. Additionally, the reference script uses a more complex setup for the beam and constraints that are not replicated in the provided code.
     - **Deductions**: 15 points for missing the custom motor function, 15 points for not having a detailed beam setup, and 10 points for not including a proper output directory setup.
     - **Total Deductions**: 40 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The provided code uses `ChSystemNSC()` while the reference uses `ChSystemSMC()`, which may lead to differences in simulation behavior, especially regarding contact handling. This is a significant error.
     - **Deductions**: 15 points for incorrect system initialization.
   - **Logical Errors**: The motor initialization in the provided code does not match the complexity and functionality of the reference code, which uses a rotational motor with a custom function.
     - **Deductions**: 10 points for logical errors in motor setup.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code is relatively readable, but it lacks comments explaining the purpose of various sections, which are present in the reference code. The variable names are somewhat generic and could be improved for clarity.
     - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments and lack of meaningful variable names.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The provided code does not optimize the beam creation and constraints as effectively as the reference code. The reference code uses builders and sections that are more efficient.
     - **Deductions**: 5 points for inefficient use of APIs in beam creation.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the success of operations, which is a common practice in robust simulations. The reference code handles various edge cases and provides more robustness.
     - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of error handling.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The provided code includes basic visualization setup but lacks the detailed visual elements and enhancements present in the reference code, such as specific visual shapes for constraints and better lighting.
     - **Deductions**: 3 points for inadequate visualization setup.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
- **Total Points Deducted**: 40 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 83 points
- **Final Score**: 100 - 83 = 17

### Final Score Output

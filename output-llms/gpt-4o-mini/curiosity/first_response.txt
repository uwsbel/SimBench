Certainly! Below is a sample simulation script using PyChrono, which initializes the environment, adds physical systems and objects, and sets default parameters. Since the specific details about the physical systems and objects were not provided, I will create a simple example involving a ground plane and a falling sphere.

```python
import pychrono.core as chrono
import pychrono.irrlicht as chronoirr

# Initialize the PyChrono environment
chrono.ChSystemNSC()  # Create a Chrono system with Non-Smooth Contact (NSC)

# Create a visualization window
application = chronoirr.ChIrrApp(chrono.ChSystemNSC(), "PyChrono Simulation", chronoirr.dimension2du(800, 600))
application.AddLogo(chrono.GetChronoDataPath() + "logo_pychrono.png")
application.SetSkyBox(chrono.GetChronoDataPath() + "skybox.jpg")
application.SetCamera(chrono.ChVectorD(0, 2, -5), chrono.ChVectorD(0, 1, 0))
application.SetLight(chrono.ChVectorD(0, 10, -10), chrono.ChVectorD(1, 1, 1))

# Create the ground plane
ground = chrono.ChBodyEasyBox(10, 0.1, 10, 1000, True, True)
ground.SetPos(chrono.ChVectorD(0, -0.05, 0))
ground.SetBodyFixed(True)  # Make the ground fixed
chrono.ChSystemNSC().Add(ground)

# Create a falling sphere
sphere_radius = 0.5
sphere = chrono.ChBodyEasySphere(sphere_radius, 1000, True, True)
sphere.SetPos(chrono.ChVectorD(0, 5, 0))  # Initial position above the ground
chrono.ChSystemNSC().Add(sphere)

# Set default parameters for the sphere
sphere.SetMaterialSurface(chrono.ChMaterialSurfaceNSC())
sphere.GetMaterialSurface().SetFriction(0.4)
sphere.GetMaterialSurface().SetRestitution(0.6)

# Set the simulation step size
chrono.ChSystemNSC().SetStep(0.01)

# Run the simulation
while application.GetDevice().run():
    application.BeginScene()
    application.DrawAll()
    application.EndScene()
    chrono.ChSystemNSC().DoStepDynamics(0.01)  # Step the simulation

# Clean up and exit
application.GetDevice().drop()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The script initializes the PyChrono environment and creates a Chrono system with non-smooth contact.
2. **Visualization**: A visualization window is created using Irrlicht, which allows for real-time rendering of the simulation.
3. **Ground Plane**: A ground plane is created and fixed in place.
4. **Falling Sphere**: A sphere is created above the ground and added to the simulation. Its material properties, such as friction and restitution, are set.
5. **Simulation Loop**: The simulation runs in a loop, updating the dynamics and rendering the scene.

You can modify the parameters and objects as needed based on your specific requirements. If you have more specific instructions or details about the physical systems and objects, please provide them, and I can adjust the script accordingly.

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, visualization setup, and simulation loop. Therefore, no points are deducted in this category.
   - **Score: 40/40**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The use of the PyChrono API appears to be correct, and there are no significant errors that would lead to a change in simulation behavior. 
   - The initialization of joints and settings for bodies are consistent with the reference script. 
   - There are no logical errors or incorrect settings noted.
   - **Score: 30/30**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names and consistent formatting. 
   - Comments are present and adequately describe the purpose of each section, although they could be slightly more detailed in some areas.
   - **Score: 8/10** (2 points deducted for minor improvements in comments)

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. 
   - It efficiently uses the PyChrono API, similar to the reference script.
   - There are no obvious optimization opportunities missed.
   - **Score: 10/10**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The code lacks explicit error handling mechanisms, which could be beneficial for robustness, especially in a simulation context.
   - There are no checks for potential issues that could arise during the simulation.
   - **Score: 0/5** (5 points deducted for lack of error handling)

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is complete and mirrors the reference script effectively. 
   - All necessary elements such as window size, title, camera position, and lighting are included.
   - **Score: 5/5**

### Summary of Deductions

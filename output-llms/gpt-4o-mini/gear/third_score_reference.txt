### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code is mostly complete, but it lacks the drawing of segments for the pulley, which is present in the reference script. This is a significant omission as it affects the visualization of the simulation. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - The code does not include the creation of a `ChLinkLockPulley` for the belt constraint, which is a critical component in the reference script. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - There are minor deviations in comments and variable naming, but they do not significantly impact completeness. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions: 35 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The use of `ChLinkLockGear` and other links appears to be correct, but the initialization of the `ChLinkLockRevolute` for the bevel gear and pulley does not match the reference script's setup, which could lead to incorrect behavior in the simulation. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - There are no significant logical errors, but the absence of the pulley link affects the overall correctness of the simulation. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions: 20 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. However, the comments could be more descriptive in some areas. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions: 5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not show any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, the absence of the belt link and the drawing segments may indicate missed optimization opportunities. **(Deduct 3 points)**
   - **Total Deductions: 3 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any explicit error handling or robustness checks, which are not present in the reference script either, but the reference script does account for common issues better. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions: 5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the absence of the drawing segments for the pulley and the use of a belt link is a significant oversight. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions: 5 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 35 points
- Correctness: 20 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 35 + 20 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 5 = 73 points
- Final Score: 100 - 73 = 27 points

### Final Score Output

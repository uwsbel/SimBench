Here's a Python script that sets up a PyChrono simulation based on your instructions. This script initializes the environment, adds a Kraz vehicle, sets up a rigid terrain, configures a driver system, and implements real-time visualization using Irrlicht.

```python
import pychrono.core as chrono
import pychrono.irrlicht as chronoirr

# Initialize the PyChrono environment
chrono.SetChronoDataPath('/path/to/chrono/data/')  # Set the path to your Chrono data
system = chrono.ChSystemNSC()

# Create a Kraz vehicle
vehicle = chrono.ChVehicle()
vehicle.SetChassisMass(5000)  # Set chassis mass
vehicle.SetWheelMass(100)      # Set wheel mass
vehicle.SetWheelRadius(0.5)    # Set wheel radius
vehicle.SetWheelWidth(0.2)     # Set wheel width
vehicle.SetInitialPosition(chrono.ChVectorD(0, 0, 0))  # Initial position

# Add the vehicle to the system
system.Add(vehicle)

# Create a rigid terrain
terrain = chrono.ChBody()
terrain.SetBodyFixed(True)
terrain.SetMaterialSurface(chrono.ChMaterialSurfaceNSC())
terrain.GetMaterialSurface().SetFriction(0.5)  # Set friction
terrain.GetMaterialSurface().SetRestitution(0.1)  # Set restitution
terrain.SetPos(chrono.ChVectorD(0, -0.1, 0))  # Position slightly below the vehicle
system.Add(terrain)

# Initialize driver system for vehicle control
driver = chrono.ChDriver()
driver.SetVehicle(vehicle)
driver.SetThrottle(0.5)  # Set throttle value
driver.SetSteering(0.1)  # Set steering value

# Create a real-time visualization using Irrlicht
app = chronoirr.ChIrrApp(system, "Kraz Vehicle Simulation", chronoirr.dimension2d(800, 600))
app.AddSkyBox()
app.AddCamera(chrono.ChVectorD(0, 5, -10), chrono.ChVectorD(0, 0, 0))  # Camera position and target
app.AddLight(chrono.ChVectorD(10, 10, 10), chrono.ChVectorD(1, 1, 1))  # Light position and color

# Simulation loop
time_step = 0.01  # Set time step for the simulation
while app.GetDevice().run():
    # Synchronize and advance the simulation
    system.DoStepDynamics(time_step)
    
    # Update driver inputs
    driver.UpdateInputs()
    
    # Render the scene
    app.DrawAll()

    # Sleep to maintain real-time execution
    chrono.ChSleep(time_step)

# Clean up
app.GetDevice().drop()
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Initialization**: The script initializes the PyChrono environment and sets the data path.
2. **Vehicle Setup**: A Kraz vehicle is created with specified mass, wheel radius, and initial position.
3. **Terrain Setup**: A rigid terrain is created with defined friction and restitution properties.
4. **Driver System**: A driver system is initialized to control the vehicle's throttle and steering.
5. **Visualization**: The Irrlicht visualization is set up with a skybox, camera, and lighting.
6. **Simulation Loop**: The loop synchronizes the vehicle, terrain, driver, and visual system at each timestep, maintaining real-time execution.

### Note:
- Make sure to adjust the path in `chrono.SetChronoDataPath()` to point to your Chrono data directory.
- You may need to install the required libraries and set up your environment to run this script successfully.

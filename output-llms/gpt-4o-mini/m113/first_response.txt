Certainly! Below is a Python script that initializes a PyChrono simulation featuring an M113 vehicle, a rigid terrain, and a driver system. It also sets up real-time visualization using Irrlicht, including camera settings and lighting. The simulation loop synchronizes and advances the vehicle, terrain, driver, and visual system at each timestep.

```python
import pychrono.core as chrono
import pychrono.irrlicht as chronoirr

# Initialize the PyChrono environment
chrono.SetChronoDataPath('/path/to/chrono/data/')  # Set your Chrono data path
system = chrono.ChSystemNSC()

# Create a rigid terrain
terrain = chrono.ChBodyEasyBox(100, 0.1, 100, 1000, True, True)
terrain.SetPos(chrono.ChVectorD(0, -0.05, 0))
terrain.SetMaterialSurface(chrono.ChMaterialSurfaceNSC())
terrain.GetMaterialSurface().SetFriction(0.8)
terrain.GetMaterialSurface().SetRestitution(0.1)
system.Add(terrain)

# Create the M113 vehicle
m113 = chrono.ChVehicle()
m113.Initialize(chrono.ChCoordsysD(chrono.ChVectorD(0, 0.1, 0), chrono.ChQuaternionD(1, 0, 0, 0)))
system.Add(m113)

# Initialize the driver system
driver = chrono.ChDriver()
driver.SetVehicle(m113)
system.Add(driver)

# Set up visualization using Irrlicht
application = chronoirr.ChIrrApp(system, "M113 Vehicle Simulation", chronoirr.dimension2d(800, 600))
application.AddTypicalSky(chrono.ChColor(0.5, 0.5, 0.5))
application.AddTypicalLights()
application.AddTypicalCamera(chrono.ChVectorD(0, 2, -5), chrono.ChVectorD(0, 0, 0))

# Set up the simulation parameters
time_step = 0.01
end_time = 10.0

# Simulation loop
while application.GetDevice().run():
    application.BeginScene()
    application.DrawAll()
    application.EndScene()

    # Advance the simulation
    system.DoStepDynamics(time_step)

    # Check for end of simulation
    if system.GetChTime() > end_time:
        break

# Clean up and exit
application.GetDevice().drop()
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Initialization**: The script starts by importing necessary PyChrono modules and initializing the simulation environment.
2. **Rigid Terrain**: A rigid terrain is created using a box shape, with specified dimensions and physical properties (friction and restitution).
3. **M113 Vehicle**: The M113 vehicle is instantiated and initialized at a specific position and orientation.
4. **Driver System**: A driver system is created to control the vehicle.
5. **Irrlicht Visualization**: The visualization is set up using Irrlicht, including sky, lights, and camera settings.
6. **Simulation Loop**: The loop runs until the application is closed or the simulation time exceeds the specified end time. It advances the simulation at each timestep and updates the visualization.

### Note:
- Make sure to replace `'/path/to/chrono/data/'` with the actual path to your Chrono data files.
- You may need to adjust the vehicle initialization and driver settings based on your specific requirements and the M113 model you are using.
- Ensure that you have the necessary PyChrono and Irrlicht libraries installed in your Python environment.

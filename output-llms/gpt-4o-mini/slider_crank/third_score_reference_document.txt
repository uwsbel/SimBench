### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. However, there are some minor deviations:
     - The reference code uses `chrono.ChLinkLockSpherical()` for spherical joints, while the provided code uses `chrono.ChLinkSpherical()`, which is incorrect. This leads to a deduction of **10 points**.
     - The reference code uses `chrono.ChLinkLockPlanar()` for the planar joint, while the provided code uses `chrono.ChLinkLockPlane()`, which is also incorrect. This leads to another deduction of **10 points**.
   - Total deductions: **20 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code has several incorrect uses of the PyChrono API:
     - The use of `chrono.ChLinkSpherical()` instead of `chrono.ChLinkLockSpherical()` for the joints leads to a deduction of **15 points**.
     - The use of `chrono.ChLinkLockPlane()` instead of `chrono.ChLinkLockPlanar()` also leads to a deduction of **15 points**.
   - Total deductions: **30 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. However, it lacks sufficient comments compared to the reference script, which provides more detailed explanations for each component.
   - Deduction for insufficient comments: **5 points**.
   - Total deductions: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code is efficient and does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows the same structure as the reference script, which is optimized.
   - Total deductions: **0 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling or robustness checks, which are not explicitly mentioned in the reference script but are generally good practices.
   - Deduction for lack of error handling: **5 points**.
   - Total deductions: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor issues with the naming of the joint types that could affect the visualization of the simulation.
   - Deduction for minor visualization issues: **3 points**.
   - Total deductions: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: **20 points**
- Correctness: **30 points**
- Code Quality: **5 points**
- Efficiency: **0 points**
- Error Handling: **5 points**
- Visualization: **3 points**

### Final Score Calculation
The total deductions amount to **63 points** from a maximum of **100 points**, resulting in a final score of **37 points**.

### Final Score

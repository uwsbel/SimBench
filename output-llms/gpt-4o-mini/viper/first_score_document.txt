### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **System Initialization**: The system is initialized correctly with `chrono.ChSystemNSC()`, but the instance is not assigned to a variable, which is necessary for further operations. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Body Creation**: The ground body is created and added correctly. However, the Viper rover and driver initialization lacks details on how these classes are defined or imported. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the application is not initialized with `application.Initialize()`, which is crucial for rendering. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **API Usage**: The gravity setting is incorrect; it should be set on the system instance, not directly on the class. The correct usage is `my_system.Set_G_acc(gravity)`. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors**: The simulation loop does not check if the application should continue running, which can lead to an infinite loop if not handled properly. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured, but variable names like `viper_rover` and `driver` could be more descriptive. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Comments**: There are minimal comments explaining the code, which could aid in understanding. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 10 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The code performs calculations for the steering angle every iteration without checking if the steering angle has reached its final value. This could be optimized. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Error Handling**: There is no error handling for potential issues such as failed initialization of the Viper rover or driver. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the lack of `application.Initialize()` affects the rendering. **(Deduct 3 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points.

### Summary of Deductions

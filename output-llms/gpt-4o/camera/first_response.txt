Certainly! Below is a PyChrono simulation script based on your instructions. This script initializes the PyChrono environment, adds a triangular mesh as a fixed body, and sets up a camera sensor with noise filters and visualizations. The camera orbits around the mesh, and the buffer data is printed at each simulation step.

```python
import pychrono as chrono
import pychrono.sensor as sens
import pychrono.irrlicht as irr
import numpy as np

# Initialize the PyChrono environment
chrono.SetChronoDataPath(chrono.GetChronoDataPath())

# Create the physical system
system = chrono.ChSystemNSC()

# Load the triangular mesh from a Wavefront .obj file
mesh = chrono.ChTriangleMeshConnected()
mesh.LoadWavefrontMesh('path/to/your/mesh.obj')

# Create a fixed body and add the mesh to it
fixed_body = chrono.ChBody()
fixed_body.SetBodyFixed(True)
fixed_body.GetCollisionModel().ClearModel()
fixed_body.GetCollisionModel().AddTriangleMesh(mesh, False, False, chrono.ChVectorD(0, 0, 0))
fixed_body.GetCollisionModel().BuildModel()
fixed_body.SetCollide(True)

# Add the fixed body to the system
system.Add(fixed_body)

# Create a sensor manager
manager = sens.ChSensorManager(system)

# Define the camera parameters
camera_update_rate = 30  # Hz
camera_offset_pose = chrono.ChFrameD(chrono.ChVectorD(0, 0, 0), chrono.QUNIT)
camera_fov = 1.408  # Field of view in radians
camera_resolution = (1280, 720)

# Create a camera sensor and attach it to the fixed body
camera = sens.ChCameraSensor(
    fixed_body,  # body to which the camera is attached
    camera_update_rate,  # update rate in Hz
    camera_offset_pose,  # offset pose
    camera_resolution[0],  # image width
    camera_resolution[1],  # image height
    camera_fov  # field of view
)

# Add noise filter to the camera
camera.PushFilter(sens.ChFilterVisualize(camera_resolution[0], camera_resolution[1], "Camera View"))
camera.PushFilter(sens.ChFilterRGBA8Access())

# Add the camera sensor to the manager
manager.AddSensor(camera)

# Create an Irrlicht application to visualize the scene
application = irr.ChIrrApp(system, "PyChrono Simulation", irr.dimension2du(1280, 720))
application.AddTypicalSky()
application.AddTypicalLogo()
application.AddTypicalCamera(irr.vector3df(0, 0, -6))
application.AddLightWithShadow(irr.vector3df(2, 4, -2), irr.vector3df(0, 0, 0), 9, 1, 9, 40)
application.AssetBindAll()
application.AssetUpdateAll()

# Simulation parameters
time_step = 0.01
simulation_time = 10  # seconds
num_steps = int(simulation_time / time_step)

# Main simulation loop
for step in range(num_steps):
    # Update the camera position to orbit around the mesh
    angle = 2 * np.pi * step / num_steps
    radius = 5
    x = radius * np.cos(angle)
    y = radius * np.sin(angle)
    z = 0
    camera.SetOffsetPose(chrono.ChFrameD(chrono.ChVectorD(x, y, z), chrono.QUNIT))

    # Perform a simulation step
    system.DoStepDynamics(time_step)
    manager.Update()
    application.BeginScene()
    application.DrawAll()
    application.EndScene()

    # Access and print the camera buffer data
    if camera.HasNewImage():
        buffer = camera.GetMostRecentRGBA8Buffer()
        print(f"Step {step}: Camera buffer data size: {len(buffer)}")

print("Simulation complete.")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The PyChrono environment and core components are initialized.
   - A physical system (`ChSystemNSC`) is created.

2. **Mesh and Fixed Body**:
   - A triangular mesh is loaded from a Wavefront .obj file.
   - A fixed body is created, and the mesh is added to it.
   - The fixed body is added to the system.

3. **Sensor Manager and Camera**:
   - A sensor manager is created.
   - A camera sensor is created and attached to the fixed body.
   - Noise filters and visualizations are applied to the camera images.
   - The camera sensor is added to the manager.

4. **Simulation Loop**:
   - The camera's position is dynamically updated to orbit around the mesh.
   - The system performs a simulation step.
   - The camera buffer data is accessed and printed at each step.

Make sure to replace `'path/to/your/mesh.obj'` with the actual path to your Wavefront .obj file. Additionally, you may need to adjust the camera parameters and simulation settings to suit your specific requirements.

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes the essential components such as system initialization, mesh creation, and visualization setup. However, it lacks the explicit disabling of gravity, which is present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - The reference script also includes a section for defining interpolation functions for reference tracking, which is absent in the provided code. This results in an additional deduction of **10 points**.
   - Total deductions: **25 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code correctly uses the PyChrono API for the most part. However, there is a logical error in the way the boundary nodes are set for the elements. The reference script uses a more structured approach to set the nodes, which could lead to differences in simulation behavior. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - There are no significant incorrect uses of the API that would lead to major simulation behavior changes, so no further deductions are warranted here.
   - Total deductions: **10 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The provided code is generally readable and well-structured. However, it lacks sufficient comments compared to the reference script, which provides better documentation of the code's purpose and functionality. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - Total deductions: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not exhibit any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, there are minor opportunities for optimization, such as the way nodes are monitored and loaded, which could be streamlined. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - Total deductions: **3 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code has basic error handling for directory creation, which is good. However, it does not account for other potential issues that the reference script handles, such as ensuring that the mesh is properly initialized before adding elements. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - Total deductions: **3 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup in the provided code is mostly correct, but it lacks the explicit setting of some visualization parameters that are present in the reference script, such as the smooth faces option. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - Total deductions: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 10 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 3 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total deductions: 49 points
- Final score: 100 - 49 = 51

### Final Score Output

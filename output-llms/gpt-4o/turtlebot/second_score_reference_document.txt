### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code is largely complete, but it uses `chrono.ChMaterialSurfaceNSC()` instead of `chrono.ChContactMaterialNSC()`, which is a more appropriate choice for defining contact materials in the context of the reference script. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Minor Omissions**: The `SetBodyFixed` method is used instead of `SetFixed`, which is a minor deviation. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The robot's motor speeds are set to `math.pi` for both wheels in the straight mode, which is inconsistent with the reference script where both wheels are set to `-math.pi`. This could lead to a significant change in simulation behavior, resulting in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: The robot's turning speeds are also not aligned with the reference script, which uses different values for left and right turns. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured and readable, but the comments could be more descriptive, particularly in the `move` function. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The code does not exhibit significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, the `move` function could be optimized by avoiding repeated calls to `SetMotorSpeed` for the same wheel. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Basic Error Handling**: The error handling in the `move` function is adequate, as it raises a `ValueError` for invalid modes. There are no significant issues here, so no deductions are necessary.
   - **Total Deductions**: 0 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the print statements could be improved for clarity and consistency with the reference script. This results in a deduction of **2 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 2 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 15 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling: 0 points
- Visualization: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 15 + 25 + 5 + 3 + 0 + 2 = 50 points
- Final Score: 100 - 50 = 50 points

### Final Score Output
[[50]]

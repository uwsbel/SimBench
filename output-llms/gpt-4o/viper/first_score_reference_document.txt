### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The provided code does not include collision settings or contact materials, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
     - The ground body in the reference script uses a material for contact, which is not set in the provided code. This results in an additional deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: 
     - The provided code uses `chrono.ChBodyEasyBox` without specifying a contact material, which could lead to different simulation behavior. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The provided code initializes the Viper rover without specifying the system, which is a logical error compared to the reference script. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The provided code is generally readable, but it lacks comments explaining the purpose of certain sections, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The provided code calculates the steering angle every loop iteration, which could be optimized by storing the maximum steering angle and adjusting it only when necessary. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling for the simulation loop or initialization, which is a basic robustness feature present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code does not include a skybox or texture for the ground, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
The total deductions amount to 70 points from a maximum of 100 points, resulting in a final score of:

**Final Score**: 100 - 70 = 30

Thus, the final score is: [[30]]

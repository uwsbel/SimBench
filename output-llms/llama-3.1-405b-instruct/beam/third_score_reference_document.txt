### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, mesh creation, beam section definition, node and element addition, force application, and visualization setup. 
   - **Deductions**: None. (0 points)

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly implements the creation of nodes and elements, applies forces, and sets up constraints. However, there is a minor logical error in the second `BuildBeam` call where it uses `builder.GetLastBeamNodes().front()` instead of `builder.GetLastBeamNodes().back()` for the starting node. This could lead to incorrect node connections.
   - **Deductions**: 10 points for the logical error in the second beam creation. (10 points)

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, with adequate comments explaining the purpose of various sections. However, some comments could be more descriptive, particularly regarding the purpose of certain parameters in the `BuildBeam` function.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments in some areas. (5 points)

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code is efficient and does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It uses the `ChBuilderBeamEuler` class effectively to create beams.
   - **Deductions**: None. (0 points)

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The code does not include any explicit error handling mechanisms, such as checks for successful initialization or valid parameter ranges. This could lead to issues if unexpected values are encountered.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of basic error handling. (5 points)

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is comprehensive, including the addition of visual shapes and a camera. However, there could be minor improvements in lighting or camera positioning for better visualization.
   - **Deductions**: 2 points for minor visualization issues. (2 points)

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points
- Correctness: 10 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total deductions: 10 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 2 = 22 points
- Final score: 100 - 22 = 78

### Final Score Output
[[78]]

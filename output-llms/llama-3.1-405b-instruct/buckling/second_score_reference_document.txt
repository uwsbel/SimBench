### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script, such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. However, there are slight deviations in dimensions and parameters that could be considered as minor omissions.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for minor deviations in dimensions and parameters.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly uses the PyChrono API in most instances. However, there are some logical errors, such as the initialization of the crank and the vertical beam, which could lead to different simulation behavior compared to the reference script.
   - **Deductions**: 10 points for logical errors in the initialization of the crank and vertical beam.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names and adequate comments. However, some comments could be more descriptive to enhance understanding.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments in some areas.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code is efficient and does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows the reference script closely in terms of efficiency.
   - **Deductions**: 0 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The code lacks explicit error handling mechanisms that could improve robustness, such as checks for successful initialization of bodies or constraints.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of basic error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor issues with the lighting and camera positioning compared to the reference script.
   - **Deductions**: 3 points for minor visualization issues.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 10 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting score: 100 points
Total deductions: 28 points
Final score: 100 - 28 = 72

### Final Score Output
[[72]]

### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **System Initialization**: The script correctly initializes the `ChSystemNSC` and sets the collision system type, which is essential. No points deducted.
   - **Body Creation**: The sphere body is created and added to the system correctly. No points deducted.
   - **Visualization**: The visualization system is set up properly, including window size, title, and camera. No points deducted.
   - **Particle Emitter**: The particle emitter is created and configured correctly. No points deducted.
   - **Callback Registration**: The callback for adding bodies is registered correctly. No points deducted.
   - **Simulation Loop**: The loop is present and structured correctly. No points deducted.
   - **Total Deductions**: 0 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **API Usage**: The use of `ChRandomShapeCreatorSpheres` and other randomizers appears correct. No points deducted.
   - **Logical Errors**: The gravitational attraction calculation is done correctly, but the gravitational constant is set to a non-standard value (6.674e-3 instead of 6.674e-11). This could lead to significant differences in simulation behavior. **Deduct 15 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured and readable. Variable names are meaningful. No points deducted.
   - **Comments**: There are insufficient comments explaining the purpose of various sections of the code. **Deduct 5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The energy calculations are performed in a straightforward manner, but the gravitational force calculation could be optimized by avoiding redundant calculations of `D_attract` and `r_attract`. **Deduct 5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Error Handling**: There is no error handling present in the script, which could lead to issues if unexpected conditions arise. **Deduct 5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but it could benefit from additional lighting or adjustments to enhance visibility. **Deduct 2 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 2 points.

### Final Score Calculation
- **Total Points Deducted**: 0 (Completeness) + 15 (Correctness) + 5 (Code Quality) + 5 (Efficiency) + 5 (Error Handling) + 2 (Visualization) = 32 points deducted.
- **Final Score**: 100 - 32 = 68.

### Final Score Output
[[68]]

### Summary of Deductions
- **Correctness**: Incorrect gravitational constant usage (15 points).
- **Code Quality**: Insufficient comments (5 points).
- **Efficiency**: Potential optimization in force calculations (5 points).
- **Error Handling**: Lack of error handling (5 points).
- **Visualization**: Minor visualization setup issues (2 points).

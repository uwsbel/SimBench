### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The provided code does not set the gravitational acceleration for the system, which is a crucial aspect of simulating a pendulum. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
     - The ground body is created using `ChBodyEasyBox`, which is not the same as the reference's `ChBody` with specific visual shapes. This is a significant deviation, leading to another **15 points** deduction.
     - The pendulum body is created using `ChBodyEasyCylinder`, which lacks the detailed setup of visual shapes and properties present in the reference. This results in another **15 points** deduction.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 + 15 + 15 = **45 points** (exceeds total points available for completeness, capped at 40).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The pendulum's mass is set incorrectly to 10 kg, while the reference uses 1 kg. This is a significant error leading to a deduction of **15 points**.
     - The inertia tensor is set to a very low value (0.1, 0.1, 0.1) which is not realistic for a pendulum of that mass. This leads to another **10 points** deduction.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 + 10 = **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is fairly readable, but lacks meaningful comments that explain the purpose of each section, which is more detailed in the reference. This leads to a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The code prints the position and velocity of the pendulum every simulation step, which can be considered inefficient for larger simulations. This leads to a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the simulation state, which the reference code implicitly handles. This leads to a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is less comprehensive than the reference. For example, it lacks a logo, skybox, and specific camera settings. This leads to a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: **40 points**
- Correctness: **25 points**
- Code Quality: **5 points**
- Efficiency: **5 points**
- Error Handling and Robustness: **5 points**
- Use of Visualization Tools: **5 points**

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a total of 100 points:
- Deductions: 40 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = **85 points**
- Final Score: 100 - 85 = **15 points**

### Final Score

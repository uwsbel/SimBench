### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: The script includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. No deductions here.
   - **Component Configuration**: The ground body is correctly set as fixed and collision detection is disabled. The pendulums are also configured correctly with mass and inertia settings. No deductions here.
   - **Minor Omissions**: The script could benefit from a brief description of the purpose of the simulation at the beginning. Deduct **5 points** for this minor omission.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: The revolute joint initialization for both pendulums appears correct, as they are connected properly. No deductions here.
   - **Logical Errors**: The pendulum positions and joint configurations are logically sound. No deductions here.
   - **Minor Inaccuracies**: The use of `chrono.ChFramed` in joint initialization could be more explicit in terms of orientation. However, this does not significantly affect the simulation. Deduct **5 points** for this minor inaccuracy.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is well-structured and readable, with consistent formatting and meaningful variable names. No deductions here.
   - **Comments**: While the code includes some comments, additional comments explaining the purpose of the simulation and the roles of each component would enhance clarity. Deduct **5 points** for insufficient comments.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The code does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. No deductions here.
   - **Optimization Opportunities**: The simulation time step is hardcoded, which could be parameterized for flexibility. Deduct **3 points** for this minor optimization opportunity.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Basic Error Handling**: The script lacks error handling mechanisms, such as checking if the bodies are successfully added to the system or if the visualization initializes correctly. Deduct **5 points** for this lack of basic error handling.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is adequate, with a window size, title, and camera position specified. No deductions here.
   - **Minor Visualization Issues**: The lighting and skybox are added, but the overall visual appeal could be improved with more detailed environmental settings. Deduct **2 points** for minor visualization issues.
   - **Total Deductions**: 2 points.

### Final Score Calculation
- **Completeness**: 5 points
- **Correctness**: 5 points
- **Code Quality**: 5 points
- **Efficiency**: 3 points
- **Error Handling and Robustness**: 5 points
- **Use of Visualization Tools**: 2 points

**Total Deductions**: 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 25 points

**Final Score**: 100 - 25 = 75

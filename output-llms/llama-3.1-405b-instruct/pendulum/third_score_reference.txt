### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. However, there are some deviations:
     - The color of the second pendulum is different from the reference (0, 0.6, 0) instead of (0, 0, 0.6). **(5 points deduction)**
     - The initial position of the second pendulum is set to (2, 0, 1) instead of (3, 0, 1). **(5 points deduction)**
     - The time step in the simulation loop is set to `1e-3` instead of `1e-2`. **(5 points deduction)**
   - Total deductions: **15 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The initialization of the revolute joint for the second pendulum is incorrect. The reference uses (2, 0, 1) while the provided code uses (1, 0, 1). **(10 points deduction)**
   - The logging output format is slightly different, which may not affect functionality but is a deviation from the reference. **(5 points deduction)**
   - Total deductions: **15 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable. However, it could benefit from more descriptive comments, especially regarding the purpose of certain sections. **(5 points deduction)**
   - Total deductions: **5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The time step for `sys.DoStepDynamics` is set to `1e-3`, which is less efficient than `1e-2` used in the reference. This could lead to unnecessary computations. **(5 points deduction)**
   - Total deductions: **5 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - There is no explicit error handling in the code. While this is not a significant issue for a simple simulation, it is a deviation from best practices. **(5 points deduction)**
   - Total deductions: **5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the title of the window is different ("Double Pendulum demo" vs. "Double Pendulum Simulation"). **(2 points deduction)**
   - Total deductions: **2 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 15 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total deductions: 47 points
- Final score: 100 - 47 = 53

### Final Score

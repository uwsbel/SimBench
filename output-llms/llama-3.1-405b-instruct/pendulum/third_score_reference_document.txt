### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script, such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. No points are deducted here.
   - **Configuration Details**: The configuration of the ground and pendulum bodies is mostly correct, but the second pendulum's initial position is set to `(2, 0, 1)` instead of `(3, 0, 1)`, which is a significant detail. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Minor Omissions**: There are no minor omissions that warrant further deductions.

   **Total Deductions for Completeness: 10 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: There are no significant incorrect uses of the PyChrono API that would lead to a change in simulation behavior. 
   - **Logical Errors**: The initialization of the revolute joints is correct, and the properties of the bodies are set appropriately. However, the time step in the simulation loop is set to `1e-3` instead of `1e-2`, which is a logical error that could affect the simulation's performance. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Minor Inaccuracies**: There are no minor inaccuracies that warrant further deductions.

   **Total Deductions for Correctness: 10 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names and consistent formatting. No points are deducted here.
   - **Comments and Documentation**: The comments are sufficient, but the reference script provides slightly better documentation in terms of clarity and detail. A deduction of **5 points** is warranted for this.

   **Total Deductions for Code Quality: 5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The code does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. No points are deducted here.
   - **Optimization Opportunities**: The time step for `sys.DoStepDynamics` is not optimized as per the reference script, which could be considered a missed opportunity for efficiency. A deduction of **3 points** is warranted.

   **Total Deductions for Efficiency: 3 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Basic Error Handling**: The code lacks explicit error handling mechanisms, which could lead to issues during execution. A deduction of **5 points** is warranted for this.

   **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the window title in the provided code is "Double Pendulum demo" instead of "Double Pendulum Simulation," which is a minor inconsistency. A deduction of **2 points** is warranted.

   **Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 10 points
- Correctness: 10 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 10 + 10 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 35 points
- Final Score: 100 - 35 = 65

### Final Score

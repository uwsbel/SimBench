### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. However, it lacks the definition of `LEFT_DRIVE_WHEEL` and `RIGHT_DRIVE_WHEEL` constants, which are important for clarity and correctness in the `move` function. 
   - **Deduction**: 10 points for missing important details in the `move` function.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code uses `SetMotorSpeed(math.pi, 0)` for the left wheel and `SetMotorSpeed(math.pi, 1)` for the right wheel when moving straight, which is incorrect as it should be the opposite based on the reference. The reference uses negative values for the motor speeds, which is crucial for correct movement direction.
   - **Deduction**: 15 points for incorrect use of the PyChrono API that could lead to significant changes in simulation behavior.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable. However, it lacks comments explaining the purpose of the `move` function and the constants used for motor control, which would enhance understanding.
   - **Deduction**: 5 points for insufficient comments.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. However, the motor speed values could be defined as constants to avoid magic numbers in the `move` function.
   - **Deduction**: 3 points for missing obvious optimization opportunities.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The error handling in the `move` function is adequate, raising a `ValueError` for invalid modes. However, it could be improved by providing more informative error messages.
   - **Deduction**: 3 points for inadequate handling of edge cases.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the print statements could be considered as a form of visualization feedback, which is not present in the reference. The reference uses more descriptive print statements.
   - **Deduction**: 3 points for minor visualization issues.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 10 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 3 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 39 points
- Final Score: 100 - 39 = 61

### Final Score

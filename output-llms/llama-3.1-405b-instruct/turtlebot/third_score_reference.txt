### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code is missing the following essential components compared to the reference script:
     - The reference script initializes the robot at a different position (5, 0, 0) instead of (0, 0.2, 0), which may affect the simulation context. **(Deduct 5 points)**
     - The reference script includes a more detailed lidar sensor configuration, including parameters like `horizontal_samples`, `vertical_samples`, and `return_mode`, which are absent in the provided code. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - The reference script includes a more comprehensive setup for the lidar sensor with additional filters and settings, which are not present in the provided code. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - Total deductions for completeness: **30 points.**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code uses `robot.SetMotorSpeed(2, 0)` and `robot.SetMotorSpeed(2, 1)` for straight movement, which is inconsistent with the reference script's use of `-math.pi` for motor speed, potentially leading to a significant change in simulation behavior. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - The robot's movement logic does not account for the correct wheel ID enumeration, which is explicitly defined in the reference script. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - Total deductions for correctness: **25 points.**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The provided code is relatively well-structured, but it lacks comments explaining the purpose of certain sections, especially in the lidar configuration and the movement function. The reference script has better documentation. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - Total deductions for code quality: **5 points.**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code has some unnecessary calculations, such as the repeated calls to `robot.SetMotorSpeed()` in the `move` function without using constants for wheel IDs. The reference script uses an enumeration for clarity and efficiency. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - Total deductions for efficiency: **5 points.**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks error handling in the `move` function, which could lead to issues if an invalid mode is passed. The reference script raises a `ValueError` for invalid modes. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - Total deductions for error handling and robustness: **5 points.**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup in the provided code is mostly adequate, but it lacks the detailed lidar visualization filters and settings present in the reference script. **(Deduct 3 points)**
   - Total deductions for visualization tools: **3 points.**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from 100 points:
- Total deductions: 30 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 73 points
- Final score: 100 - 73 = 27 points

### Final Score

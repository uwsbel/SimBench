### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks the use of a contact material for the ground body, which is present in the reference script. This is a significant omission as it affects the interaction properties of the bodies in the simulation. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - The reference script uses a specific collision system type (BULLET) which is not set in the provided code. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The provided code uses `Set_G_acc` instead of `SetGravitationalAcceleration`, which is the correct method in the reference. This could lead to confusion and incorrect behavior in the simulation. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The driver is created as a `ChPart`, which is not appropriate for controlling the rover. The reference uses a specific driver class for the Viper rover. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The code is relatively readable, but it lacks meaningful comments explaining the purpose of certain sections, especially the simulation loop and the driver setup. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The steering angle is updated in a way that could be optimized. The reference script has a more structured approach to steering that is time-dependent. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the simulation state, which could lead to issues during execution. The reference script is more robust in this regard. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code does not utilize some visualization features present in the reference, such as adding a logo or typical lights. **(Deduct 3 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
- Starting from 100 points:
  - 100 - 30 (Completeness) - 25 (Correctness) - 5 (Code Quality) - 5 (Efficiency) - 5 (Error Handling) - 3 (Visualization) = 27 points

### Final Score

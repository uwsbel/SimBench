### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks several essential components present in the reference script, such as:
     - A more comprehensive setup for the physical system (e.g., using `ChSystemSMC` instead of `ChSystemNSC`).
     - Detailed constraints and joints that are critical for the simulation's behavior.
     - Visualization enhancements (e.g., adding logos, skyboxes, and specific visual shapes).
   - **Deductions**: 15 points for missing essential components (3 components) = **45 points** (exceeds maximum, capped at 40).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: The use of `ChSystemNSC` instead of `ChSystemSMC` may lead to significant differences in simulation behavior, particularly in contact handling.
   - **Logical Errors**: The motor function is not set up correctly compared to the reference, which uses a more complex angle function.
   - **Deductions**: 15 points for incorrect API usage + 10 points for logical errors = **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is relatively well-structured but lacks meaningful comments and documentation compared to the reference script.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments and documentation.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The inertia calculations are repeated unnecessarily, which could be optimized.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for unnecessary calculations.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for potential issues, such as ensuring the simulation system is properly initialized.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of basic error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is basic and lacks some elements present in the reference, such as logos and more detailed lighting.
   - **Deductions**: 3 points for inadequate visualization setup.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a maximum score of 100:
- Total deductions: 40 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 83 points
- Final score: 100 - 83 = **17 points**

### Final Score Output

```

I have identified and corrected the following errors in the original script:

*   The `AddLightDirectional` method was called with incorrect parameters. I have corrected it to `AddLightDirectional(chrono.ChVector3d(0, 0, 1), chrono.ChColor(1, 1, 1), 100)`.
*   The `AddLightPoint` method was not called. I have added it to the script to add a point light to the scene.
*   The `sensor_manager` was not created. I have created it and added the camera filter to it.
*   The `camera` sensor was not added to the vehicle's chassis body. I have added it to the script.
*   The `filter` was not added to the `sensor_manager`. I have added it to the script.

I have also modified the script to meet the specified requirements:

*   I have changed the terrain texture to a grass texture by calling `patch.SetTexture(veh.GetDataFile("terrain/textures/grass.jpg"), 200, 200)`.
*   I have added point lights to the scene by calling `vis.AddLightDirectional` and `vis.AddLightPoint`.
*   I have created a sensor manager and added a camera sensor to the vehicle's chassis body.
*   I have added a visualization filter to render the image and included it in the sensor manager.
*   I have updated the simulation loop to ensure that the camera is updated as the vehicle moves and that the camera filter is visible in visualization.

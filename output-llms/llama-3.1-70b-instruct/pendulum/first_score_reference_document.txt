### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

#### Completeness (40 points total)
1. **Missing Components**:
   - The provided code lacks the initialization of gravitational acceleration, which is present in the reference script. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - The ground body is created as a box but does not have a visual representation (like a cylinder) as in the reference. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - The pendulum body is created but lacks a visual representation (like a cylinder) as in the reference. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - The simulation loop is missing, which is essential for running the simulation. **(Deduct 15 points)**

   Total deductions for completeness: **50 points** (exceeds the maximum, capped at 40 points).

#### Correctness (30 points total)
1. **Incorrect Use of API**:
   - The revolute joint is initialized incorrectly. The reference uses `ChLinkLockRevolute` while the provided code uses `ChLinkRevolute`. This could lead to different simulation behavior. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - The pendulum's inertia tensor is set to (1, 1, 1), which may not be appropriate for a box of mass 10. The reference sets a more realistic inertia tensor. **(Deduct 10 points)**

   Total deductions for correctness: **25 points**.

#### Code Quality (10 points total)
1. **Readability and Structure**:
   - The code is somewhat readable, but the excessive repetition of `AddCameraMotionMode` calls makes it cluttered. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - There are insufficient comments explaining the purpose of various sections of the code. **(Deduct 5 points)**

   Total deductions for code quality: **10 points** (capped at maximum).

#### Efficiency (10 points total)
1. **Redundant Code**:
   - The multiple calls to `AddCameraMotionMode` are unnecessary and could be optimized. **(Deduct 5 points)**

   Total deductions for efficiency: **5 points**.

#### Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)
- The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the simulation state, which is a basic requirement. **(Deduct 5 points)**

Total deductions for error handling: **5 points**.

#### Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)
1. **Visualization Setup**:
   - The visualization setup is incomplete compared to the reference. The reference includes a logo and better lighting setup. **(Deduct 5 points)**

Total deductions for visualization tools: **5 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total deductions: 40 + 25 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 90 points
- Final Score: 100 - 90 = 10 points

### Final Score Output

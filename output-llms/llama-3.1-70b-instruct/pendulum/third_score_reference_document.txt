### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided script lacks the explicit setting of mass and inertia properties for the pendulum bodies, which are essential for accurate dynamics. The reference script sets the mass and inertia for both pendulums.
     - **Deduction**: 15 points for each missing mass and inertia setting (total of 30 points).
   - **Minor Omissions**: The ground body in the provided script is created as a box with collision enabled, but it does not disable collision detection, which is done in the reference script.
     - **Deduction**: 5 points for this minor omission.

   **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 35 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The provided script uses `chrono.ChBodyEasyCylinder` for pendulum creation, which is not incorrect but does not allow for setting mass and inertia explicitly. The reference script uses `chrono.ChBody()` and sets these properties directly.
     - **Deduction**: 15 points for not using the recommended approach.
   - **Logical Errors**: The initialization of the revolute joints uses incorrect frames compared to the reference script. The reference script uses `chrono.ChQuaterniond(1, 0, 0, 0)` for the orientation, while the provided script uses `chrono.Q_from_AngY(math.pi/2)`, which may lead to different orientations.
     - **Deduction**: 10 points for this logical error.

   **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured and readable, but the variable names could be more descriptive (e.g., `pend_1` and `pend_2` could be named `pendulum_1` and `pendulum_2`).
     - **Deduction**: 5 points for minor readability issues.
   - **Comments**: The script has some comments, but they could be more detailed to explain the purpose of each section, similar to the reference script.
     - **Deduction**: 5 points for insufficient comments.

   **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: 10 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The time step in `sys.DoStepDynamics(1e-3)` is smaller than the reference script's `1e-2`, which is less efficient. The smaller time step may not be necessary for the simulation's accuracy.
     - **Deduction**: 5 points for this inefficiency.

   **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided script does not include any error handling or checks for the simulation state, which could lead to issues during execution.
     - **Deduction**: 5 points for lack of basic error handling.

   **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the provided script does not set the collision detection for the ground body, which could affect the visual representation.
     - **Deduction**: 3 points for this minor issue.

   **Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 35 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 35 + 25 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 83 points
- Final Score: 100 - 83 = 17 points

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code is mostly complete but lacks the explicit disabling of gravity, which is present in the reference script. This omission is significant as it can affect the simulation's behavior.
     - **Deduction**: 15 points for missing essential component (gravity handling).
   - The code does not initialize the `ref_X` and `ref_Y` functions correctly as interpolation functions, which could be important for tracking reference points.
     - **Deduction**: 10 points for incorrect configuration of reference tracking.
   - **Total Deduction**: 25 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code uses `AddLayer` with a thickness parameter but does not convert the angle to radians, which is important for accurate simulation.
     - **Deduction**: 15 points for incorrect use of the API (angle conversion).
   - There are no logical errors in the code, but the handling of boundary nodes could be clearer.
   - **Total Deduction**: 15 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is relatively well-structured, but it lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of certain sections, especially around the mesh and element creation.
     - **Deduction**: 5 points for insufficient comments.
   - **Total Deduction**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not appear to have significant inefficiencies, but there are minor opportunities for optimization, such as the way nodes and elements are created.
   - **Total Deduction**: 3 points for missing optimization opportunities.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The error handling for the output directory creation is adequate, but there is no handling for potential issues during mesh or element creation.
   - **Total Deduction**: 3 points for inadequate handling of edge cases.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor issues, such as the commented-out lines for visual shape settings that could enhance the visualization.
   - **Total Deduction**: 3 points for inadequate visualization setup.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 3 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 54 points
- Final Score: 100 - 54 = 46

### Final Score Output

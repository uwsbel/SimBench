### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: 
     - The provided code does not set up collision properties or contact materials, which are present in the reference script. This is a significant omission as it affects the simulation's realism and accuracy. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - The ground body in the reference script uses a contact material, which is not present in the provided code. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The gravity vector is set using `Set_G_acc`, which is not the standard method in the reference script. The reference uses `SetGravitationalAcceleration`, which is more appropriate. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The Turtlebot's motor control logic is overly simplistic and does not utilize the motor speed settings as in the reference script. This could lead to unrealistic behavior. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The code is generally readable, but variable names could be more descriptive (e.g., `mysystem` could be `my_system`). **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Comments**: 
     - The code lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of various sections, which is better documented in the reference script. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 10 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The simulation loop increments time manually, which is acceptable, but the reference script uses a more efficient approach by checking `vis.Run()` for loop control. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the visualization system, which could lead to crashes if the window is closed unexpectedly. The reference script handles this better. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code does not include advanced visualization features like adding a logo or skybox, which are present in the reference script. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a full score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 25 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 80 points
- Final Score: 100 - 80 = 20 points

### Final Score Output

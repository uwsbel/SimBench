### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code lacks the creation of visual shapes for the hinge constraints and the boxes, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
     - The reference script initializes a list of bodies (`self.bodies`) to keep track of the created bodies, which is not present in the provided code. This results in another deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 30 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of PyChrono API (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code uses `SetForce` on the front node of the beam, which is not consistent with the reference script where the force is applied to the back node. This could lead to significant differences in simulation behavior, resulting in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors (10 points each)**: 
     - The initialization of constraints and connections in the provided code is not as structured as in the reference script, particularly the handling of the `ChLinkNodeFrame` and `ChLinkNodeSlopeFrame`. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 to 10 points)**: 
     - The provided code is generally readable, but it lacks some structural clarity compared to the reference script. The use of comments is adequate but could be improved for clarity. A deduction of **5 points** is warranted.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations or Redundant Code (5 points each)**: 
     - The provided code has some redundancy in creating and initializing bodies and constraints. The reference script is more efficient in its approach. A deduction of **5 points** is warranted.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: 5 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Incorrect or Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 to 5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not include visualization for the hinge constraints and the boxes, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: 5 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 75 points
- Final Score: 100 - 75 = 25 points

### Final Score Output
[[25]]

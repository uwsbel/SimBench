### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided script includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. However, the long box obstacle is incorrectly configured compared to the reference script, which uses a different size and texture. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Deductions: 10 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The script correctly initializes the rover and sets its position and orientation. However, the obstacle's dimensions and texture do not match the reference script, which could lead to a significant change in simulation behavior. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Deductions: 15 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is well-structured and readable, with appropriate comments explaining each section. However, there are minor inconsistencies in comments and variable naming compared to the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Deductions: 5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The script is efficient and does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. However, there is a minor opportunity for optimization in the way the rover's dynamics are updated, which is slightly less efficient than the reference. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Deductions: 3 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The script lacks explicit error handling mechanisms, which are not present in the reference script either. However, it does not account for potential issues that could arise during simulation. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Deductions: 5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the texture for the obstacle is not consistent with the reference script, which may affect the visual representation. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Deductions: 3 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 10 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a total of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 41 points
- Final Score: 100 - 41 = 59

### Final Score Output

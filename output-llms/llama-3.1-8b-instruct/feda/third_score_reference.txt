### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components (15 points each)**: The provided code lacks the creation of a sensor manager (`ChSensorManager`) and the addition of point lights to the scene, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points** for each missing component, totaling **30 points**.
   - **Minor Omissions (5 points each)**: The provided code does not include the creation of a camera sensor, which is part of the reference script. This results in an additional deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: **35 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API (15 points each)**: The provided code does not utilize the sensor manager correctly, as it does not update the sensor manager in the simulation loop. This could lead to significant changes in simulation behavior, resulting in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors (10 points)**: The provided code does not handle the camera sensor correctly, as it lacks the necessary setup and integration with the visualization system. This results in an additional deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 points)**: The code is generally well-structured, but the lack of comments explaining the purpose of certain sections (like the sensor manager) detracts from its readability. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations (5 points)**: The provided code has some redundant calls, such as initializing the visualization multiple times without clear necessity. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling (5 points)**: The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 points)**: The provided code does not set up the visualization tools as comprehensively as the reference script, particularly in terms of lighting and camera setup. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools**: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 35 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
The total deductions amount to **35 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 78 points**. Starting from a maximum score of 100, the final score is:

**Final Score**: 100 - 78 = **22**

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks the initialization of the `ChSystemNSC`, which is crucial for setting up the simulation environment. The reference script initializes the system with `chrono.ChSystemNSC()`. **(15 points deduction)**
     - The provided code does not include a proper visualization setup, such as adding a logo, skybox, or typical lights, which are present in the reference script. **(15 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The provided code uses `ch.ChBodyEasyBox` and `ch.ChLinkTSDA` without proper initialization and configuration as seen in the reference. The reference code uses `chrono.ChBody()` and initializes the spring with a rest length, which is missing in the provided code. **(15 points deduction)**
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The spring connection does not set the rest length, which is critical for the spring-damper behavior. **(10 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The code lacks meaningful variable names and comments explaining the purpose of each section. The reference code is well-structured and includes comments. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The provided code initializes the visualization multiple times unnecessarily, which could be streamlined. The reference code is more efficient in its setup. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for successful initialization of the system or visualization, which is present in the reference. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code does not properly set up the visualization environment compared to the reference, which includes a logo, skybox, and typical lights. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
- Total Points Deducted: 75 points
- Starting Score: 100 points
- Final Score: 100 - 75 = 25

### Final Score Output

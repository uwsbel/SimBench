### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

#### Completeness (40 points total)
- **System Initialization**: The script correctly initializes the simulation system using `chrono.ChSystemNSC()`. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Body Creation**: All necessary bodies (ground, body_1, body_2) are created and configured properly. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Visualization Setup**: The visualization system is set up correctly with a window size, title, and camera. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Spring Creation**: Both springs are created and initialized correctly. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Missing Components**: There are no missing essential components. **(0 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Completeness: 0 points**

#### Correctness (30 points total)
- **Incorrect API Usage**: The use of `chrono.ChVisualShapeSphere` and `chrono.ChVisualShapeBox` is correct, and the springs are initialized properly. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Logical Errors**: The springs are initialized with the correct parameters and attached to the bodies properly. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Minor Inaccuracies**: There are no significant inaccuracies in the API calls or configurations. **(0 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Correctness: 0 points**

#### Code Quality (10 points total)
- **Readability and Structure**: The code is well-structured and easy to read. Variable names are meaningful, and the flow of the script is logical. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Comments**: The code lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of each section and the parameters used. **(5 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Code Quality: 5 points**

#### Efficiency (10 points total)
- **Unnecessary Calculations**: There are no unnecessary calculations or redundant code present. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Optimization Opportunities**: The script could potentially optimize the initialization of visual shapes by using a loop for similar objects (e.g., creating spheres for the ground), but this is a minor issue. **(3 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Efficiency: 3 points**

#### Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)
- **Basic Error Handling**: There is no error handling present in the script, which could lead to issues if the simulation encounters unexpected conditions. **(5 points deducted)**
- **Edge Cases**: The script does not account for edge cases, such as checking if the bodies are properly initialized before adding them to the system. **(3 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points**

#### Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)
- **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is adequate, but the lighting could be improved for better visibility. **(3 points deducted)**
- **Minor Issues**: There are no significant issues with the visualization elements. **(0 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points**

### Final Score Calculation
- **Total Points**: 100
- **Deductions**: 0 (Completeness) + 0 (Correctness) + 5 (Code Quality) + 3 (Efficiency) + 5 (Error Handling) + 3 (Visualization) = 16 points deducted
- **Final Score**: 100 - 16 = 84

### Final Score Output
[[84]] 

### Summary of Deductions
- **Code Quality**: Lack of comments (5 points)
- **Efficiency**: Minor optimization opportunity (3 points)
- **Error Handling**: Lack of error handling (5 points)
- **Visualization Tools**: Minor lighting improvement needed (3 points)

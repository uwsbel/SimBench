### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code is mostly complete but has some minor omissions and deviations from the reference script.
   - **Missing essential components**: The reference script includes a third body (body_2) positioned at (-1, -6, 0) instead of (0, -3, 0) as in the provided code. This is a significant deviation in terms of the simulation setup.
   - **Deduction**: 15 points for the missing body configuration.
   - **Minor deviations**: The colors of the boxes in the reference script are different from those in the provided code (green and blue instead of red). This is a minor visual detail but still a deviation.
   - **Deduction**: 5 points for color differences.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 20 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code initializes the springs correctly, but the initialization of the springs between bodies is not consistent with the reference script.
   - **Incorrect use of API**: The initialization of spring_2 and spring_3 uses incorrect body references (body_1 and body_2 instead of body_2 and body_1).
   - **Deduction**: 15 points for incorrect initialization of springs.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 15 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally readable and well-structured, but the comments could be more descriptive.
   - **Insufficient comments**: The comments are present but do not provide detailed explanations of the purpose of each section or the parameters used.
   - **Deduction**: 5 points for insufficient comments.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not have any unnecessary calculations or redundant code, and it follows the reference script's structure closely.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: 0 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for potential issues, such as ensuring that bodies are correctly initialized before being used.
   - **Deduction**: 5 points for lack of error handling.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the title of the window differs from the reference script.
   - **Deduction**: 2 points for the title difference.
   - **Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools**: 2 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 20 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 20 + 15 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 2 = 47 points
- Final Score: 100 - 47 = 53

### Final Score
[[53]]

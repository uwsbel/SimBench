### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code is missing the following essential components compared to the reference:
     - The second pendulum's initial position is set incorrectly (should be at (3, 0, 1) instead of (1, 0, 0)). **(15 points deduction)**
     - The initialization of the second revolute joint is incorrect; it should connect the second pendulum at (2, 0, 1) instead of (0, 0, 1). **(15 points deduction)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly complete but lacks the correct color for the second pendulum (should be (0, 0, 0.6)). **(5 points deduction)**
   - Total deductions: **35 points.**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The time step for `sys.DoStepDynamics` is set to `1e-3`, while the reference uses `1e-2`, which could lead to a significant difference in simulation behavior. **(15 points deduction)**
   - The joint initialization for the second pendulum is incorrect as mentioned above. **(10 points deduction)**
   - Total deductions: **25 points.**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks some comments that could enhance understanding, especially regarding the initialization of joints. **(5 points deduction)**
   - Total deductions: **5 points.**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The time step used in the simulation loop is smaller than necessary, which could lead to inefficiency. The reference script uses a larger time step, which is more efficient for this type of simulation. **(5 points deduction)**
   - Total deductions: **5 points.**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the initialization of bodies and joints, which could lead to issues if the simulation setup is incorrect. **(5 points deduction)**
   - Total deductions: **5 points.**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor issues with the color of the second pendulum and the window title (should be "Double Pendulum Simulation"). **(3 points deduction)**
   - Total deductions: **3 points.**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 35 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total deductions: 35 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 78 points
- Final score: 100 - 78 = 22

### Final Score

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code is mostly complete but lacks a few details present in the reference script. For instance, the reference script uses a more precise setting for gravity with a comment indicating the need for at least 2 integration points per element. The provided code does not include this context, which could be considered a minor omission. 
     - The reference script also specifies the order of the beam elements as `1` (linear), while the provided code uses `3` (cubic). This could lead to differences in simulation behavior.
     - **Deductions**: 15 points for the gravity comment and 15 points for the beam order discrepancy.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 30 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of PyChrono API (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code uses a custom motor function that is not aligned with the reference script's implementation. The reference script's motor function has specific parameters and behavior that differ from the provided code. This could lead to significant changes in simulation behavior.
     - **Deductions**: 15 points for the incorrect motor function.
   - **Logical Errors (10 points)**: The provided code does not have any significant logical errors, but the differences in the motor function could be considered a logical inconsistency.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 15 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 to 10 points)**: The provided code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks some comments that would help clarify the purpose of certain sections, especially around the custom motor function.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: 5 points for insufficient comments.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations or Redundant Code (5 points each)**: The provided code does not exhibit significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, the use of `m.floor()` in obtaining the middle node could be seen as slightly less efficient than directly indexing.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: 3 points for minor inefficiencies.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling (5 points)**: The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which could be important for robustness. The reference script does not explicitly handle errors either, but it is generally more robust in its setup.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Incorrect or Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 to 5 points)**: The visualization setup in the provided code is similar to the reference script but lacks some comments that explain the purpose of certain visual elements. 
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization**: 3 points for minor visualization issues.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 15 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 3 = 61 points
- Final Score: 100 - 61 = 39

### Final Score Output

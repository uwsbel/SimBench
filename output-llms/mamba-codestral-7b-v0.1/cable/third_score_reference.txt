### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components (15 points each)**: The provided code lacks the creation of visual shapes for the hinge and the boxes, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points** for each missing visual component (total of **30 points**).
   - **Minor Omissions (5 points each)**: The `PrintBodyPositions` method does not store the end bodies in the `Model1` class, which is a minor omission compared to the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Completeness: 35 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API (15 points each)**: The provided code incorrectly initializes the `ChLinkNodeFrame` and `ChLinkPointFrame` constraints without ensuring proper connections to the bodies. This could lead to significant changes in simulation behavior. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors (10 points)**: The force applied to the beam nodes is inconsistent with the reference script, which applies a force of `chrono.ChVector3d(0, -0.2, 0)`. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Correctness: 25 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 points)**: The code structure is generally good, but the naming conventions and comments could be improved for better clarity. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Insufficient Comments (5 points)**: While there are comments, they do not adequately explain the purpose of certain sections, especially the constraints. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Code Quality: 10 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations (5 points)**: The code contains some redundant calculations, such as repeatedly calculating positions for the boxes without storing them. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Missing Optimizations (3 points)**: There are opportunities for optimization in the way the beams are created and connected, which are not utilized in the provided code. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Efficiency: 8 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling (5 points)**: The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 points)**: The provided code does not include visual shapes for the hinge and boxes, which are essential for understanding the simulation. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Minor Visualization Issues (2 points)**: The visualization setup is generally adequate but lacks some elements present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **2 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 35 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 8 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 35 + 25 + 10 + 8 + 5 + 5 = 88 points
- Final Score: 100 - 88 = 12 points

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Script

#### Completeness (40 points total)
- **Missing Essential Components**: The provided script lacks several essential components that are present in the reference script. For example, the creation of the terrain and the vehicle initialization are not fully represented. 
  - **Deductions**: 
    - Missing terrain creation and configuration: **15 points**
    - Missing vehicle initialization details: **15 points**
  
  Total Deduction: **30 points**

#### Correctness (30 points total)
- **Incorrect Use of PyChrono API**: The provided script has multiple instances of incorrect API usage, particularly in the handling of vehicle and terrain parameters. 
  - **Deductions**: 
    - Incorrect vehicle setup and collision system type: **15 points**
    - Logical errors in setting up the vehicle and terrain: **10 points**
  
  Total Deduction: **25 points**

#### Code Quality (10 points total)
- **Readability and Structure**: The provided script lacks clear structure and meaningful variable names compared to the reference script. The absence of comments makes it harder to understand the code.

  - **Deductions**: 
    - Unnecessary calculations and inefficient API calls: **5 points**
  
  Total Deduction: **5 points**

#### Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)
- **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided script does not include basic error handling or robustness checks that are present in the reference script.
  - **Deductions**: 
    - Lack of basic error handling: **5 points**
  
  Total Deduction: **5 points**

#### Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)
- **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The provided script does not set up the visualization tools as effectively as the reference script.
  - **Deductions**: 
    - Inadequate visualization setup: **3 points**
  
  Total Deduction: **3 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: **30 points**
- Correctness: **25 points**
- Code Quality: **10 points**
- Efficiency: **5 points**
- Error Handling and Robustness: **5 points**
- Use of Visualization Tools: **3 points**

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 25 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 3 = **78 points**
- Final Score: 100 - 78 = **22**

### Final Score Output

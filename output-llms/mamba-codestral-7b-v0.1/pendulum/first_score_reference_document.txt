### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: 
     - The provided code does not set gravitational acceleration, which is a crucial aspect of simulating a pendulum. The reference code initializes gravity, which is essential for realistic motion. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - The ground body is added as a fixed body in the reference code, while in the provided code, it is added without being fixed. This could lead to incorrect simulation behavior. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Minor Omissions**: 
     - The reference code includes visual elements like a cylinder for the ground and pendulum, which enhance visualization. The provided code lacks these visual enhancements. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: **30 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The provided code uses `pychrono.ChSystemSMC()` instead of `pychrono.ChSystemNSC()`. The reference code uses NSC, which is more appropriate for this type of simulation. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The initialization of the revolute joint is not done correctly in the provided code. The reference code uses a specific frame for initialization, which is missing in the provided code. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: **25 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The provided code is relatively straightforward but lacks comments explaining the purpose of each section. The reference code is well-commented, enhancing readability. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The provided code does not optimize the visualization setup as effectively as the reference code, which includes additional visual elements and lighting. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **5 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for simulation conditions, which could lead to issues during execution. The reference code is more robust in this aspect. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: **5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code does not include features like adding a logo, skybox, or camera setup, which are present in the reference code. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: **5 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a full score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 75 points
- Final Score: 100 - 75 = 25

### Final Score Output
[[25]]

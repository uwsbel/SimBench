### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code is mostly complete, but it lacks the `manager.Update()` call in the simulation loop, which is present in the reference script. This is essential for updating the sensor manager. **Deduction: 15 points**.
   - All other components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization are present and correctly configured. 
   - Total deductions for completeness: **15 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code correctly uses the PyChrono API in most areas. However, the absence of `manager.Update()` could lead to incorrect sensor behavior, which is a significant change in simulation behavior. **Deduction: 15 points**.
   - There are no logical errors or incorrect settings of body properties that deviate from the reference script.
   - Total deductions for correctness: **15 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names and appropriate formatting. However, it could benefit from additional comments explaining the purpose of certain sections, especially around the simulation loop and sensor setup. **Deduction: 5 points**.
   - Total deductions for code quality: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code is efficient and does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows the reference script closely in terms of efficiency. There are no obvious optimization opportunities missed. **No deductions**.
   - Total deductions for efficiency: **0 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which could lead to issues during execution. The reference script does not explicitly handle errors either, but it is generally more robust due to the inclusion of the `manager.Update()` call. **Deduction: 5 points**.
   - Total deductions for error handling and robustness: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the commented-out line for enabling shadows could be seen as a minor issue since it may affect the visual quality of the simulation. However, this is not a significant deviation from the reference script. **Deduction: 2 points**.
   - Total deductions for visualization tools: **2 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 15 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total deductions: 15 + 15 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 2 = 42 points
- Final score: 100 - 42 = 58

### Final Score Output
[[58]]

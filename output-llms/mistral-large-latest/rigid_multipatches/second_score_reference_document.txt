### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: The provided code is missing the ability to add multiple terrain patches, which is present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Minor Omissions**: The terrain visualization setup is slightly less detailed in the provided script compared to the reference. The reference script uses `CreateFromWavefrontFile` for loading the visual mesh, while the provided script uses `LoadWavefrontMesh`, which is less optimal. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 + 5 = **20 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The provided script does not set the `mutable` property for the visual shape, which is a significant oversight. The reference script sets `tri_mesh_shape.SetMutable(False)`, which is important for performance and behavior. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: The terrain patch is added with a different method signature in the provided script compared to the reference. The reference script includes parameters for collision and restitution, which are not present in the provided script. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 + 10 = **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks some comments that would enhance understanding, especially around the terrain setup. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The provided code does not utilize the `SetMutable` property for visual shapes, which could lead to performance inefficiencies. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are important for robustness. The reference script does not explicitly handle errors either, but it is generally good practice to include checks. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The provided script does not include the `SetMutable` property for the visual shape, which is a minor but important detail for visualization efficiency. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 20 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
- Total Points Deducted: 20 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = **63 points**
- Maximum Points: 100
- Final Score: 100 - 63 = **37 points**

### Final Score Output

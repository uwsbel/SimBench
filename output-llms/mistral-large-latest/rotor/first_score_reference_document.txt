### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks several essential components present in the reference script:
     - **Mesh Creation**: The reference script creates a `ChMesh` object, which is essential for finite element analysis (FEA). The provided code does not include this, resulting in a **15-point deduction**.
     - **Material Properties**: The reference code defines material properties using `ChInertiaCosseratSimple` and `ChElasticityCosseratSimple`, which are not present in the provided code. This results in another **15-point deduction**.
     - **Gravity Settings**: The reference script sets automatic gravity for the mesh, which is missing in the provided code. This results in a **15-point deduction**.
     - **Static Linear Analysis**: The reference code performs a static linear analysis with `sys.DoStaticLinear()`, which is absent in the provided code. This results in another **15-point deduction**.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 = **60 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: The provided code uses `ChSystemNSC`, while the reference code uses `ChSystemSMC`, which is more suitable for the simulation type. This leads to a **15-point deduction**.
   - **Logical Errors**: The initialization of the flywheel and its attachment to the beam is not done correctly compared to the reference. The reference code uses a `ChLinkMateFix` for attaching the flywheel to the beam, while the provided code uses a different approach. This results in a **10-point deduction**.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 15 + 10 = **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code is relatively well-structured, but it lacks comments explaining the purpose of various sections, which are present in the reference code. This results in a **5-point deduction**.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The provided code calculates the inertia of the flywheel using a formula that is not clearly defined or necessary for the simulation context. The reference code uses a more straightforward approach. This results in a **5-point deduction**.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for successful initialization of components, which is addressed in the reference script. This results in a **5-point deduction**.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The provided code sets up visualization but lacks the detailed visual shapes and enhancements present in the reference code. This results in a **3-point deduction**.
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 60 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 60 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = **103 points** (over the maximum score)
- Final Score: 0 points (as the deductions exceed the total score).

### Final Score Output

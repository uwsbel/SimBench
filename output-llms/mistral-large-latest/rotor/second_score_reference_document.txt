### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script, such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. However, there are minor deviations:
     - The gravity setting in the reference script is noted as "Changed gravity," which suggests a specific value was chosen for a reason. The provided code uses the same value but lacks the context of why it was chosen.
     - The reference script uses `builder.GetLastBeamNodes().back()` and `builder.GetLastBeamNodes().front()` for accessing nodes, while the provided code uses indexing with `[-1]` and `[0]`, which is less clear.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for minor deviations.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code correctly implements the PyChrono API and does not contain significant errors that would lead to incorrect simulation behavior. However, there are some logical inaccuracies:
     - The use of `m.floor(len(builder.GetLastBeamNodes()) / 2.0)` is less clear than `m.floor(builder.GetLastBeamNodes().size() / 2.0)`, which is more idiomatic in C++ and Python.
     - The flywheel's initial position is set with a Y offset, which is correct, but the reference script explicitly mentions a "Changed flywheel radius," indicating that the radius might have been adjusted for a specific reason.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for minor inaccuracies.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. However, it lacks some comments that would enhance understanding, especially regarding the choice of parameters.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not exhibit unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It efficiently uses the PyChrono API as intended.
   - **Deductions**: 0 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any explicit error handling mechanisms, which could be beneficial for robustness, especially in a simulation context.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of basic error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct and aligns with the reference script. However, there are minor differences in the camera position and lighting setup that could enhance the visual experience.
   - **Deductions**: 3 points for minor visualization issues.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 5 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 5 + 5 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 3 = 23
- Final Score: 100 - 23 = 77

### Final Score Output
[[77]]

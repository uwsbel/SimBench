### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided script has a class for terrain parameters (`SCMTerrainParams`), which is a good encapsulation, but it does not include methods for initializing soft, mid, and hard parameters in a single method as seen in the reference. Instead, it uses a separate method for applying parameters. This could be considered a minor omission. 
   - **Deduction**: -5 points for slight deviations in the parameter initialization structure.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The terrain parameters in the provided script are set correctly, but the reference script uses a different initialization method for the terrain parameters. The reference script initializes parameters directly in the terrain class, which is more straightforward. 
   - **Logical Errors**: The terrain initialization dimensions in the provided script are set to `terrainLength` and `terrainWidth`, which are correct, but the reference script uses `20` for both dimensions. This discrepancy could lead to different simulation behaviors.
   - **Deduction**: -10 points for logical errors in parameter initialization and -5 points for the discrepancy in terrain dimensions.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code is generally well-structured and readable. However, the naming conventions for parameters in the `SCMTerrainParams` class do not match the reference script's conventions (e.g., `bekker_Kphi` vs. `Bekker_Kphi`), which could lead to confusion.
   - **Comments**: The provided script has sufficient comments, but they could be more descriptive in some areas.
   - **Deduction**: -5 points for inconsistent naming conventions and minor lack of clarity in comments.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The provided script does not have significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, the terrain initialization could be more concise.
   - **Deduction**: -3 points for minor optimization opportunities.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided script does not include any error handling mechanisms, such as checking for valid parameter values or ensuring that the visualization system initializes correctly.
   - **Deduction**: -5 points for lack of basic error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the reference script includes a call to `vis.AddTypicalLights()`, which is missing in the provided script. This could affect the visual quality of the simulation.
   - **Deduction**: -3 points for inadequate lighting setup.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: -5 points
- Correctness: -15 points (10 for logical errors, 5 for discrepancies)
- Code Quality: -5 points
- Efficiency: -3 points
- Error Handling: -5 points
- Visualization Tools: -3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Total points deducted: 5 + 15 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 3 = 36 points

Assuming a full score of 100 points, the final score is:
100 - 36 = 64

### Final Score

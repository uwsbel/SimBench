### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and sensor setup. However, there are minor deviations:
     - **Deduction of 5 points** for using `ch.ChFrameD` instead of `ch.ChFramed` for the camera and lidar sensors in the provided code. The reference uses a different method for frame initialization.
     - **Deduction of 5 points** for the absence of a call to `ros_manager.Update(time, time_step)` in the simulation loop, which is present in the reference script.
   - **Total Deduction: 10 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code generally adheres to the correct usage of the PyChrono API. However, there are some issues:
     - **Deduction of 10 points** for setting the mass of `mesh_body` and `ground_body` to 0, which makes them static objects. The reference script does not set mass to 0 for movable bodies.
     - **Deduction of 5 points** for minor inaccuracies, such as the incorrect use of `ch.ChVector3d` for the angular velocity of the ground body, which should be more clearly defined in the context of the simulation.
   - **Total Deduction: 15 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names and adequate comments. However, there are some areas for improvement:
     - **Deduction of 5 points** for minor formatting issues and lack of consistent commenting style compared to the reference script.
   - **Total Deduction: 5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code is efficient, but there are some redundant calculations:
     - **Deduction of 5 points** for not optimizing the update calls for the ROS manager, which could be streamlined as seen in the reference script.
   - **Total Deduction: 5 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks robust error handling:
     - **Deduction of 5 points** for not checking the success of the `sens_manager.Update()` call before proceeding with the simulation loop, which is handled in the reference script.
   - **Total Deduction: 5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor issues:
     - **Deduction of 3 points** for the use of hardcoded light positions without considering a more dynamic approach as seen in the reference script.
   - **Total Deduction: 3 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 10 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a total of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 43 points
- Final Score: 100 - 43 = 57

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks the collision system setup and contact material configuration that are present in the reference script. This is essential for realistic physics simulations.
     - **Deduction**: 15 points for missing collision system setup.
     - **Deduction**: 15 points for missing contact material configuration.
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The gravity setting uses `Set_G_acc`, which is not the standard method in the reference. The reference uses `SetGravitationalAcceleration`, which is more appropriate.
     - **Deduction**: 15 points for incorrect API usage.
   - **Logical Errors**: The Turtlebot initialization does not include the system as a parameter, which is necessary for proper initialization.
     - **Deduction**: 10 points for logical error in robot initialization.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally readable, but variable names could be more descriptive (e.g., `vis` could be `visual_system`).
     - **Deduction**: 5 points for minor readability issues.
   - **Comments**: The code lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of various sections, which is present in the reference.
     - **Deduction**: 5 points for insufficient comments.
   - **Total Deductions**: 10 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The rendering and simulation steps are handled correctly, but the motor control logic could be optimized to avoid repeated calculations.
     - **Deduction**: 5 points for minor inefficiencies.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The code does not account for potential errors in the simulation loop or initialization, which the reference script handles.
     - **Deduction**: 5 points for lack of error handling.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but it lacks some details like specific camera settings and light configurations that enhance the visual quality.
     - **Deduction**: 3 points for minor visualization issues.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 25 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 78 points
- Final Score: 100 - 78 = 22 points

### Final Score Output

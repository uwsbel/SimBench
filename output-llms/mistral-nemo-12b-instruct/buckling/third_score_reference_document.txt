### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: 
     - The output directory is named "BEAM_FAILED" instead of "BEAM_BUCKLING" as in the reference, which could indicate a lack of clarity in the simulation's purpose. (Deduct 5 points)
     - The motor type is `ChLinkMotorRotationSpeed` in the provided code, while it is `ChLinkMotorRotationAngle` in the reference. This could lead to different simulation behaviors. (Deduct 10 points)
     - The number of elements in the IGA beam is different (30 in the provided code vs. 32 in the reference). (Deduct 5 points)
     - The visualization shapes and parameters differ slightly, which could affect the clarity of the simulation output. (Deduct 5 points)
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The motor's torque function is set instead of the angle function, which is a significant deviation that affects the simulation's behavior. (Deduct 15 points)
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The dimensions and properties of the beams differ from the reference, which could lead to different physical behaviors. (Deduct 10 points)
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The code is generally well-structured, but some variable names could be more descriptive (e.g., `box_truss` vs. `boxtruss`). (Deduct 5 points)
   - **Comments**: 
     - The comments are adequate but could be improved for clarity in some areas. (Deduct 5 points)
   - **Total Deductions**: 10 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The code does not seem to have significant inefficiencies, but there are minor optimizations that could be made (e.g., using constants for repeated values). (Deduct 3 points)
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The script does not include any error handling mechanisms, which is a significant oversight. (Deduct 5 points)
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: 
     - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor differences in parameters that could affect the visual output. (Deduct 3 points)
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a total of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 71 points
- Final Score: 100 - 71 = 29 points

### Final Score Output

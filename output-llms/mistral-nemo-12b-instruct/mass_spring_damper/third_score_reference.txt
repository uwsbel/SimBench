### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code is missing the initialization of the gravitational acceleration, which is set to (0, 0, 0) in the reference script. This is a significant omission as it affects the simulation's behavior. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - The position of `body_2` is set to (0, -3, 0) in the provided code, while in the reference script it is set to (-1, -6, 0). This difference in position is a significant deviation. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - The position of `body_3` is also set to (1, -3, 0) in the provided code, while it is set to (-1, -9, 0) in the reference. This is another significant deviation. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - The provided code has a minor omission in the naming of the window title, which is less descriptive than the reference. **(Deduct 5 points)**

   **Total Deductions for Completeness: 40 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The gravitational acceleration is incorrectly set to (0, 0, -9.81) in the provided code, which is a significant change from the reference. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - The initialization of springs between bodies is correct, but the reference script uses a different initialization for the second and third springs, which could lead to different simulation behavior. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - There are no minor inaccuracies or unnecessary API calls that deviate from the reference script. 

   **Total Deductions for Correctness: 25 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally readable and structured well, but it lacks comments that explain the purpose of each section, which the reference script does provide. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - The variable names are meaningful, and the formatting is consistent.

   **Total Deductions for Code Quality: 5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not have unnecessary calculations or redundant code, but it could be optimized by following the reference script's structure more closely. **(Deduct 3 points)**
   - There are no significant optimization opportunities missed.

   **Total Deductions for Efficiency: 3 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling or robustness checks, which are not explicitly present in the reference script but are generally good practice. **(Deduct 5 points)**

   **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the window title is less descriptive than in the reference script. **(Deduct 2 points)**

   **Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points**

### Final Score Calculation
- **Total Deductions:**
  - Completeness: 40
  - Correctness: 25
  - Code Quality: 5
  - Efficiency: 3
  - Error Handling and Robustness: 5
  - Use of Visualization Tools: 2

**Total Deductions = 40 + 25 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 80 points**

Assuming the maximum score is 100 points, the final score would be:

**Final Score: 100 - 80 = 20**

### Final Output

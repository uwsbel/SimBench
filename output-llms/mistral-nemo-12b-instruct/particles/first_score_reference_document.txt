### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks the initialization of a physical system (`ChSystemNSC` or `ChSystemSMC`), which is essential for any simulation. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is present but lacks details such as adding a skybox, camera, and typical lights, which are present in the reference. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 + 10 = **25 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: The provided code uses `pc.Scene()` and `pc.Simulation()` instead of the correct `chrono.ChSystemNSC()` or `chrono.ChSystemSMC()`, which could lead to significant changes in simulation behavior. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: The gravitational force function is implemented manually, which is unnecessary since the simulation already sets gravity. This could lead to incorrect force calculations. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 + 10 = **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is relatively readable, but the variable names and structure could be improved for clarity. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Comments**: The code lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of various sections, which are present in the reference. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 + 5 = **10 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The manual gravitational force calculation for each particle is inefficient and redundant since gravity is already set in the simulation parameters. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are important for robustness. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is minimal and lacks features such as adding a logo, skybox, and typical lights, which are present in the reference. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
- Starting Score: 100 points
- Total Deductions: 25 + 25 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 73 points
- Final Score: 100 - 73 = **27 points**

### Final Score Output

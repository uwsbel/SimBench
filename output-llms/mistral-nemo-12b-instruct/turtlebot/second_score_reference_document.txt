### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. However, the `move` function in the provided code has the `WheelID` enum values defined inside the function, while in the reference script, they are defined outside. This leads to a deduction of **5 points** for minor deviation.
   - **Points Deducted: 5**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code incorrectly sets the motor speeds for the robot. In the reference script, the left and right wheel speeds are set to `-math.pi` for straight movement, while the provided code sets them to `0`. This is a significant deviation that could affect the simulation behavior, leading to a deduction of **15 points**.
   - Additionally, the turning speeds are not consistent with the reference script, which also leads to a deduction of **10 points** for logical errors.
   - **Points Deducted: 25**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but the comments could be more descriptive. The reference script provides better documentation for the `move` function. Therefore, a deduction of **5 points** for insufficient comments is warranted.
   - **Points Deducted: 5**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not have significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, the `move` function could be optimized by avoiding repeated calls to `SetMotorSpeed` for the same wheel in the same mode. This leads to a deduction of **3 points** for missing optimization opportunities.
   - **Points Deducted: 3**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code raises a `ValueError` for invalid modes in the `move` function, which is good practice. However, the reference script has a more descriptive error message. Thus, a deduction of **3 points** for inadequate error handling compared to the reference script is appropriate.
   - **Points Deducted: 3**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup in the provided code is mostly correct and matches the reference script. However, the reference script includes a more structured approach to adding lights and cameras. A deduction of **2 points** for minor visualization issues is warranted.
   - **Points Deducted: 2**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5
- Correctness: 25
- Code Quality: 5
- Efficiency: 3
- Error Handling: 3
- Visualization: 2

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a total of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 5 + 25 + 5 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 43
- Final Score: 100 - 43 = 57

### Final Score

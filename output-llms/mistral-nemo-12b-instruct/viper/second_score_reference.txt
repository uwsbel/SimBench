### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. However, the sensor manager is created after the visualization setup in the reference script, which is a minor deviation. 
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for the order of operations in setting up the sensor manager after visualization.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code correctly initializes the Viper rover and sets up the simulation loop. However, there is a minor logical error in the way the rendering is handled. The rendering logic is present but could be optimized to match the reference script more closely.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for minor inaccuracies in rendering logic.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. However, there are some comments that could be more descriptive, particularly around the sensor setup and rendering logic.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments and documentation.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code is efficient overall, but there are some unnecessary calculations in the rendering logic that could be optimized. The reference script has a more streamlined approach to rendering.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for unnecessary calculations in the rendering logic.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which could lead to issues during execution. The reference script does not explicitly handle errors either, but it is generally more robust in structure.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the commented-out shadow feature could be seen as a missed opportunity for better visual quality. The reference script includes this feature without comment.
   - **Deductions**: 3 points for inadequate visualization setup due to the commented-out shadows.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 5 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total deductions: 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 28
- Final score: 100 - 28 = 72

### Final Score

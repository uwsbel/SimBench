### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **System Initialization**: The script correctly initializes the physical system using `chrono.ChSystemNSC()`. (0 points deducted)
   - **Body Creation**: Nodes and beams are created and added to the system, fulfilling the requirement for body creation. (0 points deducted)
   - **Visualization**: The visualization setup is present, including window size, title, and camera setup. (0 points deducted)
   - **Missing Components**: The script lacks contact material settings, which are important for realistic simulations. (15 points deducted)
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **API Usage**: The use of `chrono.ChElementBeamEuler()` and its properties appears correct based on the API documentation. (0 points deducted)
   - **Logical Errors**: There are no significant logical errors in the code. (0 points deducted)
   - **Minor Inaccuracies**: The visualization of nodes and beams could be improved by ensuring that the visual shapes are correctly associated with their respective bodies. (5 points deducted)
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured and readable. However, some variable names could be more descriptive (e.g., `my_system`, `my_visualization`). (5 points deducted)
   - **Comments**: There are no comments explaining the purpose of various sections of the code, which would enhance understanding. (5 points deducted)
   - **Total Deductions**: 10 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The code does not contain significant inefficiencies or redundant calculations. (0 points deducted)
   - **Optimization Opportunities**: There are no obvious optimization opportunities that are missed. (0 points deducted)
   - **Total Deductions**: 0 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Basic Error Handling**: The script lacks error handling mechanisms, such as checking if the visualization system initializes correctly or if nodes and beams are added successfully. (5 points deducted)
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the addition of visual shapes for nodes and beams could be improved for better clarity. (3 points deducted)
   - **Minor Issues**: The lighting and camera setup are adequate, but could be enhanced for better visual quality. (2 points deducted)
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 15 points
- Correctness: 5 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Total Points Deducted: 15 + 5 + 10 + 0 + 5 + 5 = 40 points

Final Score: 100 - 40 = 60

### Final Score Output
[[60]] 

### Explanation of Deductions
The script is generally well-structured and functional, but it lacks essential components such as contact material settings and sufficient comments. Additionally, it does not include error handling, which is crucial for robustness in simulations. Minor inaccuracies in visualization setup also contributed to the deductions.

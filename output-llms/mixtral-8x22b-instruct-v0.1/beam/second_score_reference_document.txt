### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, mesh creation, beam setup, and visualization. However, it lacks the explicit creation of beam elements using `ChElementBeamEuler`, which is present in the reference script. Instead, it uses a builder approach without explicitly defining the elements.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - Missing explicit beam element creation: **15 points**.
     - Minor deviations in comments and formatting: **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: **20 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code correctly initializes the system and applies forces, but it incorrectly sets the force on `hnode2` instead of `hnode1`, which is not aligned with the reference script. Additionally, the force applied is different in magnitude and direction.
   - **Deductions**:
     - Incorrect force application: **15 points**.
     - Minor logical errors in node fixing and constraints: **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: **20 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable. However, there are some instances where comments could be more descriptive, especially regarding the purpose of certain sections.
   - **Deductions**:
     - Lack of detailed comments: **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code is efficient in its use of the builder pattern for beam creation, which is a good practice. However, there are some redundant calls, such as setting the same properties multiple times.
   - **Deductions**:
     - Minor inefficiencies in property settings: **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **3 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for potential issues, such as verifying the success of operations or the validity of parameters.
   - **Deductions**:
     - Lack of error handling: **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor issues with the configuration of visualization parameters compared to the reference script.
   - **Deductions**:
     - Minor visualization issues: **2 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools**: **2 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: **20 points**
- Correctness: **20 points**
- Code Quality: **5 points**
- Efficiency: **3 points**
- Error Handling and Robustness: **5 points**
- Use of Visualization Tools: **2 points**

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a total of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: **55 points**
- Final Score: **100 - 55 = 45**

### Final Score

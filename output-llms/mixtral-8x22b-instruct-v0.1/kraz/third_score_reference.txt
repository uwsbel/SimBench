### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code initializes a truck and a sedan, but it does not include the initialization of the sedan's tire type and step size, which is present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
     - The reference script uses a specific sedan model (`BMW_E90`), while the provided code uses a generic `Sedan()` class. This could lead to differences in behavior and performance, resulting in another deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: **30 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code does not set the tire model for the sedan correctly, which could lead to significant differences in simulation behavior. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors (10 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not set the tire step size for the sedan, which is a logical error as it could affect the simulation's accuracy. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 to 10 points)**: 
     - The provided code is generally readable but lacks some comments that would help clarify the purpose of certain sections. The reference script has better documentation practices. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations or Redundant Code (5 points each)**: 
     - The provided code has some redundancy in setting visualization types for both vehicles. This could be optimized by creating a function to handle the setup for both vehicles. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, such as checking if the vehicles are initialized correctly or if the visualization system is set up properly. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 to 5 points)**: 
     - The provided code lacks some visual elements present in the reference script, such as the specific terrain mesh and visual shapes. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools**: **5 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: **30 points**
- Correctness: **25 points**
- Code Quality: **5 points**
- Efficiency: **5 points**
- Error Handling and Robustness: **5 points**
- Use of Visualization Tools: **5 points**

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = **75 points**
- Final Score: **100 - 75 = 25 points**

### Final Score Output

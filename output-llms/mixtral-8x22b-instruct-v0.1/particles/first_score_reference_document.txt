### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks several essential components present in the reference script:
     - The reference script uses a `ChParticleEmitter` with specific configurations for particle properties, which is absent in the provided code. Instead, a custom `ParticleEmitter` class is used, which does not utilize the built-in capabilities of PyChrono.
     - The reference script includes a collision system setup (`sys.SetCollisionSystemType(chrono.ChCollisionSystem.Type_BULLET)`), which is missing in the provided code.
     - The reference code initializes a `ChContactMaterialNSC`, which is not done in the provided code.
     - The reference code uses a callback for body creation, which is not implemented in the provided code.
   - **Deductions**: 15 points for each missing essential component (4 components) = **60 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The provided code uses `np.random.choice(self.shapes)` to randomly select a shape, which is not the correct way to handle PyChrono shapes. The reference code uses a more structured approach with a particle emitter.
   - **Logical Errors**: The gravitational force calculation in the provided code does not account for the gravitational constant correctly, and it uses a simplistic approach that could lead to inaccuracies.
   - **Deductions**: 15 points for incorrect use of API (1 instance) + 10 points for logical errors (1 instance) = **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code lacks clear structure and meaningful variable names. For example, the `emit_particle` method does not clearly indicate what it does, and the gravitational force application is not well-structured.
   - **Comments**: The provided code has minimal comments explaining the purpose of various sections, which reduces its readability.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for poor readability and structure + 5 points for insufficient comments = **10 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The gravitational force calculation iterates over all pairs of bodies, which is inefficient. The reference script uses combinations to avoid redundant calculations.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for unnecessary calculations (1 instance) + 3 points for missing optimization opportunities = **8 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not implement any error handling or checks for potential issues (e.g., division by zero in gravitational force calculations).
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of basic error handling = **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The provided code initializes the visualization but does not include several visual enhancements present in the reference script, such as adding a logo, skybox, and typical lights.
   - **Deductions**: 3 points for inadequate visualization setup = **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 60 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 8 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Total points deducted: 60 + 25 + 10 + 8 + 5 + 3 = 111 points

Starting from a maximum of 100 points, the final score is:
\[100 - 111 = -11\]

Since scores cannot be negative, the final score is capped at **0**.

### Final Score

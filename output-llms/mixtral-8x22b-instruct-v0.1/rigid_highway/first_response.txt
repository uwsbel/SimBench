To create a PyChrono simulation of a full HMMWV on a custom mesh terrain using Irrlicht for visualization, follow these steps:

1. Initialize the PyChrono environment and core components:

```python
import pychrono as chrono
import pychrono.irrlicht as chronoirr
import pychrono.vehicle as veh

# Create the Chrono::Engine physical system
physics_system = chrono.ChSystemNSC()

# Create the Irrlicht visualization system
visualization_system = chronoirr.ChIrrApp(physics_system, 'HMMWV Simulation', chronoirr.Dim3d(800, 600))

# Enable contact visualization
visualization_system.AddTypicalLogo(chronoirr.GetChronoDataFile('logo_pychrono_alpha.png'))
visualization_system.AddTypicalSky(chronoirr.GetChronoDataFile('skybox/dawnmountain_ft.jpg'))
visualization_system.AddTypicalLights()
visualization_system.AddTypicalCamera(chronoirr.vector3df(0, 10, -20))
visualization_system.AddTypicalFPS()
visualization_system.SetChaseCamera(chronoirr.ChTrackballWin(visualization_system.GetSystem(), visualization_system.GetVideoDriver()))
visualization_system.SetTryRealtime(True)
```

2. Add the required physical systems and objects:

```python
# Create the HMMWV vehicle
vehicle = veh.ChVehicle(veh.ChassisHMMWV())

# Set the vehicle's location, orientation, and contact method
vehicle.SetContactMethod(chrono.ChContactMethod_NSC)
vehicle.SetChassisFixed(False)
vehicle.SetInitPosition(chrono.ChCoordsysD(chrono.ChVectorD(0, 0, 0.5), chrono.Q_from_AngX(chrono.CH_C_PI_2)))

# Add the TMEASY tire model
tire_model = veh.ChTMeasyTire()

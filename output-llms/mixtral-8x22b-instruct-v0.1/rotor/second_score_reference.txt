### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. However, there are minor deviations from the reference script, such as the gravity setting and the flywheel dimensions being slightly different. 
   - **Deductions: 5 points** for minor deviations in parameters and comments.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code uses the PyChrono API correctly in most instances. However, the gravity setting and the flywheel dimensions differ from the reference script, which could lead to a significant change in simulation behavior.
   - **Deductions: 15 points** for incorrect use of parameters that could affect simulation results.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. However, it lacks some comments that could enhance understanding, especially in sections where important parameters are set.
   - **Deductions: 5 points** for insufficient comments.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not appear to have any unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows a similar structure to the reference script, which is efficient.
   - **Deductions: 0 points** for efficiency.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The code does not include any explicit error handling mechanisms. While it may not be strictly necessary for this simulation, the reference script does not handle any potential errors either.
   - **Deductions: 0 points** for error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is similar to the reference script, but there are minor differences in the camera position and lighting setup.
   - **Deductions: 2 points** for minor visualization issues.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling: 0 points
- Visualization: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- 100 - (5 + 15 + 5 + 0 + 0 + 2) = 73

### Final Score

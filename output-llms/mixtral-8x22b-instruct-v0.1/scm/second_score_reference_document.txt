### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks the use of a dedicated class for terrain parameters, which is present in the reference script. This is a significant omission as it encapsulates the terrain parameter setup and enhances code organization. **(15 points deduction)**
   - **Incorrect Configuration**: The terrain parameters are set directly in the provided code instead of using the `SCMParameters` class. This is a deviation from best practices and reduces code clarity. **(10 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The terrain parameters are not set using the `SCMParameters` class, which could lead to inconsistencies in how terrain properties are managed. This is a significant change in simulation behavior. **(15 points deduction)**
   - **Logical Errors**: The terrain parameters are hardcoded instead of being initialized through a method, which could lead to errors if changes are needed. **(10 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured, but the lack of a dedicated class for terrain parameters affects readability. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Comments**: The code lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of various sections, especially around the terrain setup. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 10 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The terrain parameters are set directly rather than through a structured class, which could lead to redundancy if multiple configurations are needed. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include error handling for the terrain parameter initialization, which could lead to runtime errors if invalid parameters are passed. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the absence of typical lighting and camera settings as seen in the reference script is a minor issue. **(3 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 73 points
- Final Score: 100 - 73 = 27 points

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script. No essential components are missing.
   - **Deductions**: 0 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code uses the PyChrono API correctly, with no significant changes in simulation behavior compared to the reference script.
   - There are no logical errors or incorrect settings of body properties.
   - **Deductions**: 0 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names and consistent formatting.
   - However, there are some minor comments that could be improved for clarity, especially in the simulation loop.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code is efficient and does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code.
   - There are no obvious optimization opportunities that the reference script implements.
   - **Deductions**: 0 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The code lacks explicit error handling mechanisms, which could be beneficial for robustness.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of basic error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct and follows the reference script closely.
   - However, the commented-out line for enabling shadows could be seen as a minor issue, as it may affect the visual quality.
   - **Deductions**: 3 points for minor visualization issues.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points
- Correctness: 0 points
- Code Quality: -5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: -5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: -3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Total points deducted: 5 + 5 + 3 = 13 points.
Starting from a total of 100 points, the final score is:

**Final Score: 100 - 13 = 87**

Thus, the final score is: [[87]]

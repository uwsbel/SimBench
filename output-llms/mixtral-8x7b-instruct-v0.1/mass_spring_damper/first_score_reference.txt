### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks the initialization of the `ChSystemNSC`, which is essential for setting up the simulation environment. This is a significant omission compared to the reference script. **(15 points deduction)**
     - The reference script uses a fixed ground body and specifies its collision settings, which are not present in the provided code. **(15 points deduction)**
   - **Minor Omissions**: 
     - The provided code does not include a visualization of the spring, which is present in the reference script. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 35 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: 
     - The provided code incorrectly uses `RigidBody` instead of `ChBody`, which could lead to significant differences in behavior. **(15 points deduction)**
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The mass body is added using `my_application.addBody(mass_box)`, but `mass_box` is not defined in the provided code; it should be `mass_body`. **(10 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The code lacks meaningful variable names and has inconsistent formatting, which affects readability. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Comments**: 
     - There are insufficient comments explaining the purpose of various sections of the code, especially compared to the reference script. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: 10 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The provided code does not optimize the use of API calls effectively, such as not using the `SetFixed` method for the ground body. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are important for robustness. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code does not include a proper setup for the visualization system, such as adding a logo or skybox, which are present in the reference script. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: 5 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 35 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 35 + 25 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 85 points
- Final Score: 100 - 85 = 15 points

### Final Score Output

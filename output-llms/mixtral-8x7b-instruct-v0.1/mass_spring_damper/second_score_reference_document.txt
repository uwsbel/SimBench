### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. However, there is a minor omission in the `MySpringForce` class where the `evaluate` method is not used correctly, leading to a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions: 5 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The `AddForce` method in the `MySpringForce` class does not align with the reference script's expected behavior. The reference uses an `evaluate` method that takes parameters for time, rest length, current length, velocity, and link, which is a more standard approach. This leads to a deduction of **15 points** for incorrect use of the PyChrono API.
   - Additionally, the `spring_2` initialization uses `chrono.ChLinkSpring()` instead of `chrono.ChLinkTSDA()`, which is a significant deviation from the reference script, leading to another deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Total Deductions: 30 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is reasonably well-structured and readable, but it lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of various sections and methods, which is a best practice highlighted in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions: 5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, the unnecessary complexity in the `MySpringForce` class could be simplified. Thus, a minor deduction of **3 points** for missing optimization opportunities is warranted.
   - **Total Deductions: 3 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are essential for robustness. This leads to a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions: 5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor issues with the lighting and camera positioning compared to the reference script. A deduction of **2 points** is appropriate here.
   - **Total Deductions: 2 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 30 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a full score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 5 + 30 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 50 points
- Final Score: 100 - 50 = 50

### Final Score Output
[[50]]

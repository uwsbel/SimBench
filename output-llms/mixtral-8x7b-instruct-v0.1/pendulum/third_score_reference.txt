### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components (15 points each)**: 
     - The second pendulum's visualization cylinder is incorrectly named `cyl_1` instead of `cyl_2`, which is a minor but notable oversight. **(5 points deduction)**
     - The initial position of the second pendulum is set to `(2, 0, 1)` instead of `(3, 0, 1)` as in the reference script. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Incorrect Configuration (10 points)**: 
     - The revolute joint initialization for the second pendulum is incorrect. The reference script uses `(2, 0, 1)` while the provided code uses `(0, 0, 1)`. **(10 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: **20 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API (15 points)**: 
     - The time step for `sys.DoStepDynamics(1e-3)` is smaller than the reference's `1e-2`, which could lead to performance issues. **(15 points deduction)**
   - **Logical Errors (10 points)**: 
     - The revolute joint initialization for the second pendulum is incorrect as mentioned above. **(10 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: **25 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 points)**: 
     - The code is generally well-structured, but the naming inconsistency for visualization shapes detracts from clarity. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Comments (5 points)**: 
     - The comments are adequate but could be improved for clarity and detail. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **10 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations (5 points)**: 
     - The time step used in the simulation loop could lead to unnecessary calculations if the simulation is not stable. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **5 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Basic Error Handling (5 points)**: 
     - There is no error handling present in the code, which is a significant oversight. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling**: **5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup (3 points)**: 
     - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the naming inconsistency for the second pendulum's visualization shape detracts from clarity. **(3 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: **3 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 20 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 68 points
- Final Score: 100 - 68 = 32

### Final Score Output

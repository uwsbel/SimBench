### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, ground body creation, robot creation, and visualization setup. However, the `move` function in the provided code lacks the definition of wheel IDs, which is crucial for controlling the motors correctly. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions: 10 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The `move` function in the provided code uses incorrect motor speed values. The reference script uses negative values for motor speeds, which is likely intended to move the robot forward. The provided code uses positive values, which could lead to incorrect simulation behavior. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - Additionally, the provided code does not define the wheel IDs, which could lead to logical errors in controlling the robot. This results in another deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions: 25 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The provided code is generally readable and well-structured. However, the comments are less detailed compared to the reference script, which could help in understanding the code better. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions: 5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not exhibit any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, the `move` function could be optimized by avoiding repeated calls to `SetMotorSpeed` for the same wheel ID. This results in a deduction of **3 points** for missing optimization opportunities.
   - **Total Deductions: 3 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code includes basic error handling for invalid modes in the `move` function. However, it lacks handling for potential runtime errors that could occur during the simulation loop. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions: 3 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup in the provided code is mostly correct but lacks the addition of a skybox, which is present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions: 3 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 10 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling: 3 points
- Visualization: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 49 points
- Final Score: 100 - 49 = 51

### Final Score Output

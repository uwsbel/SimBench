### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **System Initialization**: The provided code initializes a `ChSystemSMC()` instead of `ChSystemNSC()`, which is a significant deviation. This leads to a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Body Creation**: The ground and mass bodies are created, but the ground is not fixed, and the mass is not set with inertia properties. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Spring Initialization**: The spring is initialized correctly, but it lacks the rest length parameter, which is crucial for the spring behavior. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Visualization**: The visualization setup is present but lacks the detail and clarity of the reference script. For example, the mass visualization is not as clear as the reference's box shape. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: **50 points** (over the maximum possible, capped at 40).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **API Usage**: The use of `ChSystemSMC()` instead of `ChSystemNSC()` is a significant error that could lead to different simulation behavior. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: The mass body lacks proper inertia settings and is not positioned correctly relative to the spring. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is relatively readable, but variable names could be more descriptive. The structure is acceptable but could benefit from better organization. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Comments**: The code lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of various sections, which are present in the reference. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **10 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The code does not exhibit significant inefficiencies, but the use of `ChBodyEasySphere` could be considered less efficient than creating a body and setting its properties explicitly. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **3 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Error Handling**: The code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are important for robustness. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is adequate but lacks the detail and completeness of the reference script. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points (capped)
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Deductions: 40 + 25 + 10 + 3 + 5 + 3 = 86 points
- Final Score: 100 - 86 = 14

### Final Score Output

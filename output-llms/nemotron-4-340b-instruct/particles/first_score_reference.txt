### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks several essential components present in the reference script:
     - The reference script initializes a collision system and sets specific material properties for the bodies, which are not present in the provided code. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
     - The reference script uses a specific texture for the visual representation of the bodies, which is missing in the provided code. This results in another deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points for missing essential components.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The provided code uses `chrono.ChSystemSMC()` while the reference uses `chrono.ChSystemNSC()`, which could lead to significant differences in simulation behavior. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: The gravitational force calculation in the provided code does not account for the gravitational constant, which is a significant logical error compared to the reference script. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points for incorrect API usage and logical errors.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code is relatively readable, but it lacks meaningful comments and documentation compared to the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments and documentation.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The provided code calculates the gravitational force in a less efficient manner than the reference script, which uses a more structured approach with combinations. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points for inefficient calculations.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points for lack of error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The provided code does not set up the visualization as comprehensively as the reference script, which includes additional visual elements like a logo and skybox. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points for inadequate visualization setup.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 75 points
- Final Score: 100 - 75 = 25

### Final Score Output
[[25]]

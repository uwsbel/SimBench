### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks several essential components present in the reference script:
     - **Initialization of Visualization**: The visualization system is not properly initialized and attached to the system. (Deduct 15 points)
     - **Driver System**: The reference script includes a driver system for user interaction, which is absent in the provided code. (Deduct 15 points)
     - **Terrain Creation**: The reference script includes terrain setup, which is missing in the provided code. (Deduct 15 points)
     - **Vehicle Initialization**: The reference script initializes a vehicle with specific parameters, while the provided code only creates a simple pendulum. (Deduct 15 points)
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 = **60 points** (capped at 40 points).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The code incorrectly creates multiple instances of `chrono.ChSystemSMC()` instead of using a single instance. This can lead to significant issues in simulation behavior. (Deduct 15 points)
   - **Logical Errors**: The pendulum body is created but lacks proper mass and inertia settings, which are crucial for accurate dynamics. (Deduct 10 points)
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 15 + 10 = **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code lacks meaningful comments and is not well-structured. The variable names could be more descriptive. (Deduct 5 points)
   - **Insufficient Comments**: There are minimal comments explaining the purpose of each section of the code. (Deduct 5 points)
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: 5 + 5 = **10 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The code redundantly creates new instances of the system multiple times instead of reusing the same instance. (Deduct 5 points)
   - **Missing Optimization**: The simulation loop could be optimized to include better rendering and synchronization practices. (Deduct 3 points)
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: 5 + 3 = **8 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms or checks for the simulation state. (Deduct 5 points)
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is incomplete and does not utilize the features available in the reference script, such as camera setup and lighting. (Deduct 5 points)
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: 5 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 8 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 40 + 25 + 10 + 8 + 5 + 5 = **93 points**.

Final Score: 100 - 93 = **7 points**.

### Final Score Output

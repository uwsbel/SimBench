### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components (15 points each)**:
     - The provided code does not set the data path for Chrono assets, which is essential for loading vehicle models and textures. This is present in the reference script. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - The terrain is created as a rigid body instead of using the `RigidTerrain` class, which is more appropriate for vehicle simulations. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API (15 points each)**:
     - The provided code uses `chrono.ChSystemSMC()` without specifying the contact method for the vehicle, which can lead to unexpected behavior. The reference script uses `chrono.ChSystemNSC()` and specifies the contact method. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors (10 points)**:
     - The vehicle is not initialized properly with parameters like mass, inertia, and visualization types, which are crucial for accurate simulation. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 to 10 points)**:
     - The code lacks comments explaining the purpose of various sections, which makes it harder to understand. The reference script has better documentation. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations or Redundant Code (5 points)**:
     - The code redundantly sets visualization types for each wheel individually, which could be done in a loop. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling (5 points)**:
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for successful initialization of components, which is present in the reference script. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 to 5 points)**:
     - The visualization setup is less comprehensive than in the reference script, lacking features like typical lights and camera tracking. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 75 points
- Final Score: 100 - 75 = 25 points

### Final Score Output

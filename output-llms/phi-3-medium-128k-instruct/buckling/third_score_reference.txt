### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code lacks the creation of the vertical beam and its associated constraints, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of 15 points.
     - The provided code does not include the creation of the crank beam and its constraints, which are also present in the reference script. This results in another deduction of 15 points.
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API (15 points each)**: 
     - The motor is initialized as `ChLinkMotorRotationSpeed` in the provided code, while the reference uses `ChLinkMotorRotationAngle`. This could lead to significant differences in simulation behavior, resulting in a deduction of 15 points.
   - **Logical Errors (10 points)**: 
     - The reference script uses `vB` for the crank position, while the provided code uses `vC + vG`, which may not be logically consistent with the intended simulation. This results in a deduction of 10 points.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 to 10 points)**: 
     - The provided code is generally readable, but it lacks some clarity in variable naming and structure compared to the reference script. This results in a deduction of 5 points.
   - **Comments (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code has comments, but they are less detailed than those in the reference script. This results in a deduction of 5 points.
   - **Total Deductions**: 10 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code includes some redundant calculations, such as the unnecessary use of `chrno.ChFramed` for visual shapes that could be simplified. This results in a deduction of 5 points.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for common issues, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of 5 points.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 to 5 points)**: 
     - The provided code lacks the comprehensive visualization setup present in the reference script, including the addition of visual shapes for constraints and proper lighting. This results in a deduction of 5 points.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 25 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 80 points
- Final Score: 100 - 80 = 20 points

### Final Score Output
[[20]]

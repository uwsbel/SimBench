### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The provided code does not include a proper visualization setup as seen in the reference script. The reference script initializes a visual system and sets up a camera, while the provided code lacks these essential components. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - The provided code does not include any visual shapes for the bodies, which is present in the reference script. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: 
     - The `chrono.ChLinkTSDA` is initialized incorrectly in the provided code. The reference script uses `spring_1.Initialize(body_1, ground, ...)` which is missing in the provided code. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The mass body is not given inertia properties, which is crucial for accurate simulation. The reference script sets inertia properties for `body_1`. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The provided code has poor readability due to excessive repetition in the visualization options setup (many lines are redundant). This makes it difficult to follow. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Comments**: 
     - The provided code lacks comments explaining the purpose of various sections, which are present in the reference script. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 10 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Redundant Code**: 
     - The provided code has many redundant calls to `SetUseAutomaticLightCasters(1)`, which is unnecessary and inefficient. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the initialization of the system or bodies, which could lead to runtime errors. The reference script handles such cases better. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code does not properly set up the visualization system as seen in the reference script. The reference script includes a complete setup for visualization, including adding a logo, skybox, and camera. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
The total deductions amount to 80 points from a maximum of 100 points.

**Final Score**: 100 - 80 = 20

### Final Score Output
[[20]]

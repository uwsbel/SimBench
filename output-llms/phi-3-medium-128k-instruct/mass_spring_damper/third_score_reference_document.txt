### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: 
     - The reference script includes three bodies (`body_1`, `body_2`, `body_3`) with specific positions and visual shapes. The provided code initializes `body_2` and `body_3` but places `body_2` at `0, -3, 0` instead of `-1, -6, 0` and `body_3` at `1, -3, 0` instead of `-1, -9, 0`. This is a significant deviation from the reference script, leading to a deduction of **15 points** for each body that is incorrectly positioned.
     - **Total Deductions**: 30 points (15 for `body_2`, 15 for `body_3`).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of PyChrono API**: 
     - The initialization of springs (`spring_2` and `spring_3`) connects `body_1` to `body_2` and `body_2` to `body_3` using the wrong reference points. The reference script correctly initializes `spring_2` to connect `body_1` to `body_2` and `spring_3` to connect `body_2` to `body_3`. This leads to a deduction of **15 points** for incorrect initialization.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The provided code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks some comments that explain the purpose of certain sections, especially around the creation of bodies and springs. The reference script has more detailed comments, which enhance understanding.
     - **Total Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations or Redundant Code**: 
     - The provided code does not exhibit significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. Both scripts are similar in terms of efficiency.
     - **Total Deductions**: 0 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the successful initialization of bodies or springs. The reference script does not explicitly handle errors either, but it is generally a good practice to include checks.
     - **Total Deductions**: 5 points for lack of error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: 
     - The visualization setup in the provided code is similar to the reference script, with no significant issues. Both scripts correctly initialize the visualization system and add visual elements.
     - **Total Deductions**: 0 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 0 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting with a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 15 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 0 = 55
- Final Score: 100 - 55 = 45

### Final Score Output
[[45]]

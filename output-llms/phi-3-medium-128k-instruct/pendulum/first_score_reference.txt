### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks the setting of gravitational acceleration, which is present in the reference script. This is an essential component for simulating realistic physics. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - The reference script includes visual shapes for both the ground and the pendulum, which are missing in the provided code. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The provided code uses `ChBodyAO` which is not the standard body class for dynamic simulations in PyChrono. The reference uses `ChBody`, which is more appropriate. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The inertia tensor for the pendulum is set to zero in the provided code, which is incorrect. The reference script sets a non-zero inertia tensor. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The provided code lacks meaningful variable names and has less structured formatting compared to the reference. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Comments**: 
     - The provided code has minimal comments explaining the purpose of various sections, while the reference script includes more detailed comments. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 10 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The provided code does not optimize the visualization setup and rendering loop as effectively as the reference script. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not implement any error handling or robustness checks, which are present in the reference script. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code does not include visual shapes for the pendulum and ground, which are crucial for visualization. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 25 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 80 points
- Final Score: 100 - 80 = 20 points

### Final Score Output

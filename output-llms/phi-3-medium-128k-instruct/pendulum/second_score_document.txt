   **Total Deductions: 0 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: There are no unnecessary calculations or redundant code. (0 points deducted)
   - **Optimization Opportunities**: The code is efficient and does not present obvious optimization opportunities. (0 points deducted)

   **Total Deductions: 0 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Basic Error Handling**: There is no explicit error handling in the simulation loop, which could be improved. (5 points deducted)
   - **Edge Cases**: The code does not account for potential edge cases, such as simulation termination conditions. (3 points deducted)

   **Total Deductions: 8 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is adequate, with a window, camera, and lighting. (0 points deducted)
   - **Minor Issues**: No significant issues with the visualization setup. (0 points deducted)

   **Total Deductions: 0 points**

### Final Score Calculation
- **Initial Score**: 100 points
- **Total Deductions**: 8 points
- **Final Score**: 100 - 8 = 92 points

### Final Score Output
[[92]] 

### Explanation of Deductions
- **Error Handling and Robustness**: The code lacks basic error handling and does not account for edge cases, which is important for robustness in simulations. This led to an 8-point deduction. All other categories were well executed, resulting in no additional deductions.

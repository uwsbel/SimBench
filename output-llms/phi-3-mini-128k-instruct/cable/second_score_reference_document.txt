### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. However, there is a missing line that sets the solver in the system, which is present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - Total deductions: **15 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly uses the PyChrono API in most places. However, there is a logical error in the solver setup where the solver is not added to the system (`sys.SetSolver(solver)` is missing). This could lead to significant changes in simulation behavior. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - Total deductions: **15 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names and adequate comments. However, it could benefit from slightly more detailed comments in some sections. Thus, a deduction of **5 points** is warranted for insufficient comments.
   - Total deductions: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. However, it misses an opportunity to optimize the solver setup by directly setting it in the system. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - Total deductions: **3 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The code lacks explicit error handling mechanisms, such as checks for successful initialization of the system or components. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - Total deductions: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct and follows the reference script closely. However, there are minor differences in the lighting setup and visualization details. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - Total deductions: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: **15 points**
- Correctness: **15 points**
- Code Quality: **5 points**
- Efficiency: **3 points**
- Error Handling and Robustness: **5 points**
- Use of Visualization Tools: **3 points**

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total deductions: 15 + 15 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 3 = **46 points**
- Final score: 100 - 46 = **54 points**

### Final Score Output

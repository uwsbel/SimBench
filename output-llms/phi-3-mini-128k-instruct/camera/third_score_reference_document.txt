### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks the camera sensor addition to the sensor manager, which is present in the reference script. This is a significant omission. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - The visual representation of the box is not properly configured as in the reference script (missing texture setup). **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The `box` is created and added to the system, but the reference script uses a different approach by adding the box directly to the physical system without creating an additional body for visualization. This could lead to confusion in simulation behavior. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The camera is attached to `box_body`, which is fixed, while the reference script attaches the camera directly to the box. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the simulation. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The code is relatively well-structured, but it lacks meaningful comments in some areas, especially around the sensor setup and camera configuration. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The code has redundant body creation and visual shape attachment that could be streamlined. The reference script does this more efficiently. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the success of operations (e.g., adding sensors or visual shapes). The reference script includes more robust handling. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code does not include the visualization of the camera output or the proper setup for visualizing the box texture, which is present in the reference script. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
The total deductions amount to 70 points from a maximum of 100 points.

**Final Score**: 100 - 70 = 30

### Final Score Output

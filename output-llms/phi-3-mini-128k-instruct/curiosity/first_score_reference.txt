### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks several essential components that are present in the reference script:
     - **System Initialization**: The reference script initializes a `ChSystemNSC`, while the provided code uses `ChSystemAtom()`, which is not appropriate for this context. **(-15 points)**
     - **Collision System Setup**: The reference script sets up a collision system type and parameters, which are missing in the provided code. **(-15 points)**
     - **Visualization Setup**: The reference script includes a visualization setup using Irrlicht, which is completely absent in the provided code. **(-15 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: **-45 points** (exceeds the maximum, capped at 40 points).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Use**: The provided code incorrectly uses `ChSystemAtom()` instead of a more suitable system type. This could lead to significant differences in simulation behavior. **(-15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors**: The gravitational force calculation is done manually and does not account for the correct physics setup as seen in the reference. The reference script uses built-in gravitational settings. **(-10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: **-25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code lacks comments and meaningful variable names, making it less readable than the reference script. **(-5 points)**
   - **Insufficient Comments**: There are no comments explaining the purpose of the code sections, which is a significant omission compared to the reference. **(-5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **-10 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The gravitational force is calculated manually instead of using built-in methods, which is less efficient. **(-5 points)**
   - **Missing Optimizations**: The provided code does not optimize for collision detection or simulation steps as seen in the reference. **(-3 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **-8 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for potential issues, which the reference script does. **(-5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling**: **-5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The provided code does not include any visualization setup, which is a significant shortcoming compared to the reference. **(-5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: **-5 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: **-40 points**
- Correctness: **-25 points**
- Code Quality: **-10 points**
- Efficiency: **-8 points**
- Error Handling: **-5 points**
- Visualization Tools: **-5 points**

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a full score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 40 + 25 + 10 + 8 + 5 + 5 = 93 points
- Final Score: 100 - 93 = 7 points

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

#### Completeness (40 points total)
1. **System Initialization**: The system is correctly initialized with `chrono.ChSystemNSC()`, and gravitational acceleration is set. **(0 points deducted)**
2. **Body Creation**: Two bodies (`body_1` and `body_2`) are created and added to the system, and their properties are set. However, `body_2` is referenced before it is created when initializing `spring_2`. **(10 points deducted)**
3. **Visualization Setup**: The visualization system is set up correctly with a window size, title, logo, skybox, camera, and lights. **(0 points deducted)**
4. **Spring Initialization**: The springs are created and initialized properly, but the second spring references `body_2` before it is defined. **(10 points deducted)**
5. **Comments and Documentation**: The code contains some comments, but they could be more detailed, especially for complex sections like the custom force functor. **(5 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Completeness: 35 points**

#### Correctness (30 points total)
1. **API Usage**: The API is mostly used correctly, but the initialization of `spring_2` is incorrect due to referencing `body_2` before its creation. **(15 points deducted)**
2. **Logical Errors**: The custom force functor's `ComputeForce` method incorrectly calculates the damping force. It should use the relative velocity instead of `rel_pos.GetSpeed()`, which is not defined in this context. **(10 points deducted)**
3. **Minor Inaccuracies**: There are no significant minor inaccuracies. **(0 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Correctness: 35 points**

#### Code Quality (10 points total)
1. **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured and readable, but the use of comments could be improved for clarity. **(5 points deducted)**
2. **Documentation**: There are insufficient comments explaining the purpose of the custom force functor and the spring initialization. **(5 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Code Quality: 10 points**

#### Efficiency (10 points total)
1. **Unnecessary Calculations**: The code does not contain unnecessary calculations, but the custom force calculation could be optimized. **(0 points deducted)**
2. **Optimization Opportunities**: There are no significant optimization opportunities that are missed. **(0 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Efficiency: 0 points**

#### Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)
1. **Basic Error Handling**: There is no error handling in the code, which could lead to crashes if unexpected situations arise. **(5 points deducted)**
2. **Edge Cases**: The code does not account for potential edge cases, such as the absence of bodies or links. **(3 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness: 8 points**

#### Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)
1. **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the lighting could be improved for better visibility. **(3 points deducted)**
2. **Minor Issues**: There are no significant minor visualization issues. **(0 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points**

### Final Score Calculation
- **Total Points Deducted**: 35 (Completeness) + 35 (Correctness) + 10 (Code Quality) + 0 (Efficiency) + 8 (Error Handling) + 3 (Visualization) = 91 points deducted.
- **Final Score**: 100 - 91 = 9

### Final Score Output
[[9]] 

### Brief Explanation of Deductions
- **Completeness**: Missing essential components and details, particularly with the initialization of `body_2` and `spring_2`.
- **Correctness**: Incorrect references and logical errors in the force calculations.
- **Code Quality**: Lack of detailed comments and explanations for complex sections.
- **Error Handling**: No error handling or consideration for edge cases.
- **Visualization**: Adequate setup but could improve lighting for better visibility.

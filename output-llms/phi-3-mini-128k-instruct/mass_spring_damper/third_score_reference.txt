### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: The provided code is missing the creation of `body_2` and `body_3` with their respective visualization assets, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points** for each missing body and visualization asset.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 (body_2) + 15 (body_3) = **30 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The initialization of springs between bodies is incorrect. In the reference script, `spring_2` and `spring_3` are initialized with the correct body references and relative positions. The provided code incorrectly initializes these springs, leading to a deduction of **15 points** for each incorrect spring initialization.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 (spring_2) + 15 (spring_3) = **30 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code lacks comments that explain the purpose of each section, which makes it less readable compared to the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points** for insufficient comments.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The provided code does not exhibit any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. Therefore, there are no deductions in this category.
   - **Total Deductions**: **0 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling or robustness checks, which are not explicitly present in the reference script but are generally good practices. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup in the provided code is mostly correct, but it lacks some of the visual elements and details present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **3 points** for inadequate visualization setup.
   - **Total Deductions**: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: **30 points**
- Correctness: **30 points**
- Code Quality: **5 points**
- Efficiency: **0 points**
- Error Handling and Robustness: **5 points**
- Use of Visualization Tools: **3 points**

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 30 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 3 = **73 points**
- Final Score: 100 - 73 = **27 points**

### Final Score Output

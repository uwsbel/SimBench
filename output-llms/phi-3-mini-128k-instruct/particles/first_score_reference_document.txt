### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks several essential components compared to the reference script:
     - **System Initialization**: The reference script uses `chrono.ChSystemNSC()` for system creation, while the provided code incorrectly uses `chrono.ChSystemContext()`, which is not appropriate for initializing a simulation system. **(-15 points)**
     - **Body Creation**: The reference script creates a sphere body with specific properties, while the provided code does not create any physical bodies. **(-15 points)**
     - **Visualization Setup**: The reference script includes a comprehensive setup for visualization, including adding a logo, skybox, and camera, which is not present in the provided code. **(-15 points)**
   - Total deductions for completeness: **(-45 points)**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code has several incorrect uses of the PyChrono API:
     - **Incorrect System Type**: Using `chrono.ChSystemContext()` instead of `chrono.ChSystemNSC()` or `chrono.ChSystemSMC()` is a significant error. **(-15 points)**
     - **Particle Emitter Configuration**: The particle emitter in the provided code lacks configuration for particles per second and reservoir settings, which are present in the reference. **(-10 points)**
     - **Gravitational Force Implementation**: The custom gravitational force function is not implemented correctly, as it does not consider the distance properly and could lead to incorrect force calculations. **(-10 points)**
   - Total deductions for correctness: **(-35 points)**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks meaningful comments and documentation compared to the reference script, which has clear explanations for each component. **(-5 points)**
   - The structure of the code is somewhat disorganized, making it harder to follow. **(-5 points)**
   - Total deductions for code quality: **(-10 points)**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code contains unnecessary calculations in the custom gravitational force function, which could be optimized. **(-5 points)**
   - The main loop could be more efficient by avoiding redundant calls to `system.GetParticles()` within the loop. **(-3 points)**
   - Total deductions for efficiency: **(-8 points)**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks basic error handling, such as checking if the particle emitter or system is properly initialized before use. **(-5 points)**
   - Total deductions for error handling: **(-5 points)**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup in the provided code is inadequate compared to the reference script, which includes additional visual elements like lighting and a logo. **(-5 points)**
   - Total deductions for visualization: **(-5 points)**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: **-45 points**
- Correctness: **-35 points**
- Code Quality: **-10 points**
- Efficiency: **-8 points**
- Error Handling: **-5 points**
- Visualization: **-5 points**

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a total of 100 points:
- Total deductions: **-108 points**
- Final score: **0 points** (as scores cannot go below zero)

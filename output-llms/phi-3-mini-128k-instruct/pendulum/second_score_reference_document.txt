### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code is missing the following components compared to the reference:
     - The reference uses a cylinder for visualization of the pendulum and ground, while the provided code uses spheres. This is a significant deviation as it affects the visual representation of the simulation.
     - The reference code initializes the pendulum's angular velocity using `SetPosDt`, which is more appropriate for setting the initial velocity rather than angular velocity. The provided code uses `SetAngVel`, which is correct but not consistent with the reference's approach.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - Missing essential visualization shapes (15 points).
     - Incorrect configuration of the pendulum's initial velocity (10 points).
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: The use of `SetAngVel` is correct but differs from the reference's approach, which could lead to confusion regarding the intended behavior of the pendulum.
   - **Logical Errors**: The pendulum's initial position and velocity settings are logically correct, but the reference code uses a different method for setting the initial velocity, which could lead to different interpretations of the simulation's initial state.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - Minor inaccuracies in API usage (5 points).
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured and readable. However, the variable names could be more descriptive (e.g., `sphere_1` and `cyl_1` could be named to reflect their purpose better).
   - **Comments**: The comments are mostly adequate, but some could be more detailed to explain the reasoning behind certain choices.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - Minor issues with variable naming and comments (5 points).
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The code does not exhibit significant inefficiencies compared to the reference. However, the time step in `sys.DoStepDynamics(1e-3)` could be considered smaller than necessary, as the reference uses `1e-2`, which may be sufficient for the simulation.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - Minor inefficiency in time step choice (3 points).
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Error Handling**: The code lacks any form of error handling or checks for the success of operations, which could lead to issues during execution.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - Lack of basic error handling (5 points).
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the use of spheres instead of cylinders for the pendulum and ground is a significant deviation.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - Incorrect visualization shapes (5 points).
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 5 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 48 points
- Final Score: 100 - 48 = 52

### Final Score Output

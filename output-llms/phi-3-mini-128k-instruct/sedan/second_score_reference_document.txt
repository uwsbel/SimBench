### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: 
     - The second vehicle is created but lacks the initialization of the driver system in a more structured way, similar to the reference script. The reference script uses a dedicated driver class for each vehicle, while the provided code initializes two drivers separately without a clear structure. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Minor Omissions**: 
     - The reference script initializes the second vehicle using `vehicle_2 = veh.BMW_E90(vehicle.GetSystem())`, which is more efficient than creating a new instance without passing the system. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: **20 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The provided code does not set the steering and throttle inputs for the vehicles in a dynamic way (e.g., sinusoidal input as in the reference). This could lead to a significant change in simulation behavior. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The provided code lacks the structured input handling for the drivers, which is present in the reference. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The provided code is less structured, especially in the driver initialization section. The variable names are less consistent, and the overall flow is harder to follow compared to the reference. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Comments and Documentation**: 
     - The provided code lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of certain blocks, which are present in the reference. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **10 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The provided code has redundant calls to set visualization types for each vehicle, which could be optimized. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Missing Optimization Opportunities**: 
     - The initialization of the second vehicle could be done in a more efficient way, similar to the reference. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **8 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for successful initialization of vehicles or drivers. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code does not include dynamic camera adjustments or advanced visualization features that are present in the reference. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools**: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: **20 points**
- Correctness: **25 points**
- Code Quality: **10 points**
- Efficiency: **8 points**
- Error Handling and Robustness: **5 points**
- Use of Visualization Tools: **3 points**

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 20 + 25 + 10 + 8 + 5 + 3 = **71 points**
- Final Score: **100 - 71 = 29**

### Final Score Output

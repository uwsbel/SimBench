### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code is missing the following essential components:
     - The loop for running the simulation and collecting data is completely absent. This is a significant omission as it prevents the simulation from executing and visualizing results. **(-15 points)**
     - The code does not include the plotting section at the end of the simulation, which is present in the reference script. This is also essential for analyzing the results. **(-15 points)**
   - The visualization setup is present but lacks the addition of typical lights, which enhances the visual quality. **(-5 points)**
   - Total Deductions: **35 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code has a logical error in the initialization of the prismatic joint. The reference script uses `chrono.Q_ROTATE_Z_TO_X`, while the provided code does not specify this rotation correctly. **(-10 points)**
   - The motor initialization is correct, but the absence of the simulation loop means that the motor's functionality cannot be verified. **(-5 points)**
   - Total Deductions: **15 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally readable, but the formatting is inconsistent, particularly in the visualization section where there are many unnecessary line breaks and misplaced parentheses. **(-5 points)**
   - Comments are present but could be more descriptive in some areas. **(-3 points)**
   - Total Deductions: **8 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not contain any unnecessary calculations or redundant code, but the lack of a simulation loop means it cannot be evaluated for efficiency in execution. **(-3 points)**
   - Total Deductions: **3 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - There is no error handling present in the provided code, which is a significant oversight. The reference script does not explicitly handle errors but is structured to allow for better robustness. **(-5 points)**
   - Total Deductions: **5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is incomplete as it lacks typical lights, which are included in the reference script. **(-3 points)**
   - Total Deductions: **3 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: **-35 points**
- Correctness: **-15 points**
- Code Quality: **-8 points**
- Efficiency: **-3 points**
- Error Handling and Robustness: **-5 points**
- Use of Visualization Tools: **-3 points**

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 35 + 15 + 8 + 3 + 5 + 3 = 69 points
- Final Score: 100 - 69 = **31**

### Final Score Output

This folder contains all the conversations between 22 different S-LLMs and 34 unique mechatronic systems. These conversations are designed for creating PyChrono simulation scenarios, that is, creating digital twins of a mechatronic system and then running a simulation with it. All conversations are formatted in the standard Stanford Alpaca JSON file format, making them convenient to use for future applications.

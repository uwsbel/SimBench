### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks several components present in the reference script:
     - The reference script includes a custom function for motor control, which is absent in the provided code. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - The reference script uses a Pardiso solver, which is more suitable for stiffness matrices, while the provided code uses a MINRES solver. This is a significant omission. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - The reference script includes a more comprehensive visualization setup, including additional visual shapes and a grid, which are not present in the provided code. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 35 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: The provided code uses `chrono.ChForce.FORCE` and `chrono.ChFunction_Ramp`, which may not be the best choices for applying loads in a dynamic simulation. The reference script uses a more sophisticated approach with a custom function for motor control. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors**: The provided code does not properly set up the beam elements as in the reference script, which could lead to inaccuracies in simulation behavior. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code is generally well-structured, but it lacks meaningful comments and documentation compared to the reference script. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The provided code initializes the gravitational acceleration twice, which is redundant. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for potential issues during simulation setup, which is present in the reference script. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The provided code lacks the detailed visualization setup found in the reference script, such as the addition of a logo, skybox, and grid. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: 5 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 35 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 80 points
- Final Score: 100 - 80 = 20 points

### Final Score Output

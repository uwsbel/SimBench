### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks the explicit initialization of the collision system type, which is present in the reference script. This is a significant omission as it affects the simulation's collision handling. **(15 points deduction)**
     - The reference script includes setting visualization types for various vehicle components, which is missing in the provided code. **(15 points deduction)**
   - **Minor Omissions**: 
     - The provided code does not include the output of the vehicle mass, which is a useful feature in the reference script. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: **35 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The provided code uses `chrono.ChContactMethod_NSC` directly instead of initializing a contact material as done in the reference script. This could lead to differences in simulation behavior. **(15 points deduction)**
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The provided code does not set the tire step size, which is important for tire dynamics. This could lead to inaccuracies in tire behavior during the simulation. **(10 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: **25 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The provided code is generally well-structured but lacks some comments that would help explain the purpose of certain sections, especially for someone unfamiliar with the code. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The provided code does not have any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, it could benefit from better organization of the initialization steps. **(3 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **3 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms or checks that could improve robustness, which are present in the reference script. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: **5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code sets up visualization but lacks some elements like adding a logo or skybox, which enhances the visual experience. **(3 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools**: **3 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 35 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 35 + 25 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 3 = 76 points
- Final Score: 100 - 76 = 24 points

### Final Score Output

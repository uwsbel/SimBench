### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. However, there are minor deviations in the naming conventions and some comments that could enhance clarity.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - **5 points** for minor omissions in comments and naming conventions that could improve clarity.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly implements the spring-damper system and uses the custom force functor appropriately. However, the `MySpringForce` class's `__call__` method should ideally match the reference's `evaluate` method signature for consistency with the PyChrono API.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - **10 points** for the incorrect method signature of the custom force functor, which could lead to confusion or errors in usage.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of each section and the parameters used.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - **5 points** for insufficient comments and documentation compared to the reference script.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code is efficient and does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows the reference script's structure closely.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - **0 points** as there are no significant inefficiencies.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The code does not include any error handling mechanisms. While this may not be critical for a simple simulation, it is a best practice to include basic error handling.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - **5 points** for the lack of error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor differences in the naming of the window title and the lack of comments explaining the visualization setup.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - **3 points** for minor visualization issues and lack of comments.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: -5 points
- Correctness: -10 points
- Code Quality: -5 points
- Efficiency: -0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: -5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: -3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 5 + 10 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 3 = 28
- Final Score: 100 - 28 = 72

### Final Score

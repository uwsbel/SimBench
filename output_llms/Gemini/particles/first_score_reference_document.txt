### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code is missing a few essential components that are present in the reference script:
     - **Collision System Initialization**: The reference script initializes a collision system (`sys.SetCollisionSystemType(chrono.ChCollisionSystem.Type_BULLET)`), which is missing in the provided code. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - **Contact Material Setup**: The reference script defines a contact material for the sphere body, which is not done in the provided code. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - **Particle Emitter Configuration**: The reference uses a more sophisticated particle emitter setup with various randomizers and properties, while the provided code uses a simpler approach. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - Total deductions for completeness: **40 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code uses `chrono.ChBodyEasySphere` to create particles, which is correct, but it lacks the density and collision properties that are set in the reference script. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - The gravitational force calculation in the `CustomGravity` function is correct, but the gravitational constant used in the reference script is different and more appropriate for the simulation context. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - The particle emission logic does not account for the particle reservoir or advanced properties set in the reference. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - Total deductions for correctness: **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The provided code is relatively well-structured and readable, but it lacks detailed comments explaining the purpose of each section and function. The reference script has better documentation. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - Total deductions for code quality: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The nested loop for applying custom gravity between all particle pairs is inefficient, especially as the number of particles increases. The reference script uses combinations to avoid redundant calculations. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - Total deductions for efficiency: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for edge cases, such as ensuring that the particle emitter does not exceed the maximum number of particles. The reference script handles these aspects better. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - Total deductions for error handling and robustness: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup in the provided code is functional but lacks some of the enhancements present in the reference script, such as adding a logo and skybox. **(Deduct 3 points)**
   - Total deductions for visualization tools: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total deductions: 40 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 83 points
- Final Score: 100 - 83 = 17 points

### Final Score

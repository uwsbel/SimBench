### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks the creation of a fixed body (truss) and the end bearing, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points** for each missing essential component (2 components = 30 points).
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The gravity is set to zero in the provided code (`system.Set_G_acc(chrono.ChVectorD(0, 0, 0))`), while the reference script uses a gravitational acceleration of `chrono.ChVector3d(0, -9.81, 0)`. This is a significant error affecting simulation behavior, leading to a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The motor is connected to the wrong body (the ground instead of the fixed truss), which is a logical error. This results in an additional deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The provided code is generally well-structured, but it lacks meaningful comments explaining the purpose of various sections, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The provided code does not have significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script, but it could benefit from using the `ChBuilderBeamIGA` utility for beam creation, which is more efficient. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the initialization of bodies or links, which is a basic requirement for robustness. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: 
     - The visualization setup in the provided code is less comprehensive than in the reference script. It lacks additional visual elements like logos and specific camera settings. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
The initial score is 100 points. The total deductions amount to 73 points.

Final Score: **100 - 73 = 27**

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, mesh creation, beam section setup, and visualization. However, there are some deviations:
     - The comment about the beam setup is less descriptive than in the reference script. (Deduct 5 points)
     - The reference script uses `chrono.ChFramed` while the provided code uses `chrono.ChFrameD`, which is a minor deviation but could lead to confusion. (Deduct 5 points)
   - **Total Deductions: 10 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code uses `chrono.CH_C_DEG_TO_RAD` correctly for the section rotation, which is a positive aspect.
   - However, there is a potential issue with the use of `chrono.ChFrameD` instead of `chrono.ChFramed`, which could lead to a significant change in simulation behavior. (Deduct 15 points)
   - The force and torque application to nodes is correct, and the constraints are set up properly.
   - **Total Deductions: 15 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks some comments that would enhance understanding, especially around the constraints and force applications. (Deduct 5 points)
   - **Total Deductions: 5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not have any unnecessary calculations or redundant code compared to the reference script. It uses the `ChBuilderBeamEuler` efficiently.
   - **Total Deductions: 0 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks explicit error handling, which is not present in the reference script either. However, it does not account for potential issues that could arise during simulation.
   - **Total Deductions: 5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the comments and descriptions are less detailed than in the reference script. (Deduct 3 points)
   - **Total Deductions: 3 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 10 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- 100 - (10 + 15 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 3) = 62

### Final Score

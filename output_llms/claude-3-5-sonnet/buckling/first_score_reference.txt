### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks several components that are present in the reference script:
     - The reference script uses a `ChSystemSMC` instead of `ChSystemNSC`, which may affect the simulation behavior. (Deduct 15 points)
     - The reference script includes a more complex setup for the beam and constraints, which is not fully replicated in the provided code. (Deduct 15 points)
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: The provided code uses `ChLinkMotorLinearPosition` instead of `ChLinkMotorRotationAngle`, which is a significant deviation affecting the simulation behavior. (Deduct 15 points)
   - **Logical Errors**: The motor function in the provided code is a sinusoidal function, while the reference uses a more complex function that defines specific angles based on conditions. This could lead to different simulation outcomes. (Deduct 10 points)
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code is reasonably structured but lacks comments explaining the purpose of various components, which the reference script does well. (Deduct 5 points)
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The provided code does not seem to have significant inefficiencies, but it could benefit from optimizations in the way the beam is created and visualized. However, no major inefficiencies are noted compared to the reference. (Deduct 3 points)
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Basic Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are present in the reference script. (Deduct 5 points)
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The provided code has a basic visualization setup but lacks the detailed visual elements and enhancements present in the reference script, such as the addition of a logo and skybox. (Deduct 3 points)
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
- Total Points Deducted: 30 + 25 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 3 = 71 points
- Starting Score: 100 points
- Final Score: 100 - 71 = 29 points

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks the initialization of the collision system type, which is present in the reference script. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - The reference script includes a specific visualization setup for vehicle parts (suspension, steering, wheels) that is missing in the provided code. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of PyChrono API**: 
     - The provided code uses `chrono.ChSystemNSC()` but does not set the collision system type, which can lead to different simulation behavior. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The vehicle's visualization type is set to `veh.TireVisualizationType_PRIMITIVES`, but the reference script uses a more comprehensive setup for visualization types. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The provided code is generally well-structured, but it lacks comments explaining key sections, which reduces readability. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The provided code has a redundant call to `vis.Synchronize("", driver_inputs)` which is not necessary as the reference script does not include this. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for common issues, such as verifying the initialization of components. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code does not include a chase camera setup, which is present in the reference script. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 75 points
- Final Score: 100 - 75 = 25 points

### Final Score

   - **Visualization System**: The visualization system is set up correctly. (0 points deducted)
   - **Simulation Loop**: The loop is present and structured correctly. (0 points deducted)
   - **Clean Up**: Properly closes the visualization device. (0 points deducted)

   **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 0 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **API Usage**: All API calls appear to be used correctly according to the documentation. (0 points deducted)
   - **Logical Errors**: No logical errors detected in the code. (0 points deducted)
   - **Minor Inaccuracies**: No unnecessary API calls or minor inaccuracies noted. (0 points deducted)

   **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 0 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is well-structured and readable, with appropriate spacing and indentation. (0 points deducted)
   - **Comments**: There are no comments explaining the code, which is a significant omission. (5 points deducted)

   **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: No unnecessary calculations or redundant code detected. (0 points deducted)
   - **Optimization Opportunities**: No obvious optimization opportunities were missed. (0 points deducted)

   **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: 0 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Basic Error Handling**: There is no error handling present, which is a significant oversight. (5 points deducted)

   **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is adequate, but it could benefit from additional features like typical lights or camera adjustments. (3 points deducted)
   - **Minor Visualization Issues**: No significant minor issues noted. (0 points deducted)

   **Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools**: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
- **Total Points Deducted**: 0 (Completeness) + 0 (Correctness) + 5 (Code Quality) + 0 (Efficiency) + 5 (Error Handling) + 3 (Visualization) = 13 points
- **Final Score**: 50 - 13 = 37

### Final Score Output
[[37]]

### Brief Explanation of Deductions
- **Code Quality**: Lack of comments explaining the code led to a deduction.
- **Error Handling**: The absence of error handling mechanisms resulted in a full deduction.
- **Visualization Tools**: Minor deductions for not utilizing additional visualization features effectively.

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code is mostly complete but has some deviations from the reference script.
   - **Deductions**:
     - **5 points** for the incorrect gravitational acceleration vector (should be `chrono.ChVector3d(0, -9.81, 0)` instead of `chrono.ChVectorD`).
     - **5 points** for the incorrect initialization of the ground body (should be `chrono.ChBody()` instead of `chrono.ChBodyEasyBox`).
     - **5 points** for the incorrect position of `body_2` (should be `(-1, -6, 0)` instead of `(1, -3, 0)`).
     - **5 points** for the incorrect position of `body_3` (should be `(-1, -9, 0)` instead of `(3, -3, 0)`).
     - **5 points** for the incorrect initialization of springs (the initialization of `spring_2` and `spring_3` should use the correct reference points).
   - Total Deductions: **25 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code has several logical errors that could affect the simulation.
   - **Deductions**:
     - **15 points** for incorrect use of `chrono.ChVectorD` instead of `chrono.ChVector3d` in multiple instances.
     - **10 points** for incorrect initialization of springs (the reference points for `spring_2` and `spring_3` are not correctly set).
   - Total Deductions: **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is relatively readable but lacks sufficient comments and documentation.
   - **Deductions**:
     - **5 points** for insufficient comments explaining the purpose of each section of the code.
     - **5 points** for lack of meaningful variable names and formatting.
   - Total Deductions: **10 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit significant inefficiencies, but there are some areas for improvement.
   - **Deductions**:
     - **3 points** for minor inefficiencies in the way bodies and springs are initialized (could be done in a loop or function).
   - Total Deductions: **3 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The code lacks error handling for potential issues that could arise during simulation.
   - **Deductions**:
     - **5 points** for the absence of basic error handling or checks for the validity of body and spring configurations.
   - Total Deductions: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct but has minor issues.
   - **Deductions**:
     - **3 points** for minor visualization issues, such as the camera position not being optimal compared to the reference.
   - Total Deductions: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 25 + 25 + 10 + 3 + 5 + 3 = 71 points
- Final Score: 100 - 71 = 29 points

### Final Score Output

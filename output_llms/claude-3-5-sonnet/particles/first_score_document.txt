### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Initialization**: The script correctly initializes the `ChSystemNSC` and sets gravity to zero. It also creates the visualization application with a camera, lights, and sky. **(0 points deducted)**
   - **Particle Emitter**: The particle emitter function is present and correctly configured, allowing for the emission of particles within specified parameters. **(0 points deducted)**
   - **Gravitational Force**: The custom gravitational force class is implemented correctly. **(0 points deducted)**
   - **Simulation Loop**: The simulation loop is present and structured correctly. **(0 points deducted)**
   - **Total Deductions**: **0 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **API Usage**: The use of `chrono.ChBodyEasySphere` is appropriate, but the mass setting should be done before adding the body to the system. The gravitational force application is also correct. **(10 points deducted)**
   - **Logical Errors**: The gravitational force calculation is correct, but the force functor should be added to the body after it is created and before it is added to the system. **(10 points deducted)**
   - **Total Deductions**: **20 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. **(0 points deducted)**
   - **Comments**: While there are some comments, more detailed comments explaining the purpose of each section would improve clarity. **(5 points deducted)**
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The gravitational force calculation iterates through all particles for each particle, which could be optimized by maintaining a list of active particles. **(5 points deducted)**
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Error Handling**: There is no error handling for potential issues, such as exceeding the maximum number of particles or invalid positions. **(5 points deducted)**
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is adequate, but there could be improvements in lighting or additional visual elements. **(3 points deducted)**
   - **Total Deductions**: **3 points**

### Final Score Calculation
- **Completeness**: 0 points deducted
- **Correctness**: 20 points deducted
- **Code Quality**: 5 points deducted
- **Efficiency**: 5 points deducted
- **Error Handling and Robustness**: 5 points deducted
- **Use of Visualization Tools**: 3 points deducted

**Total Deductions**: 38 points  
**Final Score**: 100 - 38 = 62

### Final Score Output
[[62]] 

### Brief Explanation of Deductions

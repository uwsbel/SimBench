### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code has a custom class `SCMTerrainParameters` instead of using the reference class `SCMParameters` with methods for initializing parameters. This results in a deduction of **15 points** for not adhering to the reference structure.
   - **Minor Omissions**: The terrain parameters are set directly in the custom class rather than using the structured methods in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 20 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The `SetPlotType` method uses `veh.SCMTerrain.PlotType_SINKAGE`, which is incorrect as per the reference that uses `veh.SCMTerrain.PLOT_SINKAGE`. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: The terrain parameters for the "mid" configuration differ from the reference script (e.g., `elastic_K` is set to `5e7` in the provided code, while it is `2e8` in the reference). This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code is generally well-structured, but the custom class could be better documented. There are no comments explaining the purpose of the class or its methods. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The code does not show significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script, but the custom class could be streamlined. However, no major deductions are warranted here.
   - **Total Deductions**: 0 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Basic Error Handling**: The provided code raises a `ValueError` for invalid terrain configurations, which is good. However, it lacks additional error handling that could be present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the reference script includes a call to `vis.AddTypicalLights()`, which is missing in the provided code. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 20 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 3 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
The total deductions amount to **76 points** from a maximum of **100 points**, resulting in a final score of **24 points**.

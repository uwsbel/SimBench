### Evaluation of the Provided Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: 
     - The `mesh_body` is set to be fixed (`SetFixed(True)`) in the provided code, while in the reference it is movable (`SetFixed(False)`). This is a significant difference as it changes the behavior of the simulation. **Deduction: 15 points**.
     - The `ground_body` in the provided code is not set to have a mass of 0, which is crucial for it to be treated as a static object in the simulation. **Deduction: 10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 25 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of PyChrono API**: 
     - The `mesh_body` is incorrectly configured with a non-zero mass, which contradicts the intended behavior of a static object. **Deduction: 15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The `ground_body` is also incorrectly set with a non-zero mass in the provided code. **Deduction: 10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but there are minor issues with comments that could be improved for clarity. The provided code has sufficient comments, but they could be more descriptive in some areas. **Deduction: 5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not show significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, the unnecessary setting of mass for static bodies could be considered a minor inefficiency. **Deduction: 3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: 3 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include checks for potential errors in sensor updates or initialization, which are present in the reference script. **Deduction: 5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the lighting and visual elements could be optimized. The provided code has the same point lights as the reference but lacks some minor optimizations. **Deduction: 2 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools**: 2 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 25 + 25 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 65 points
- Final Score: 100 - 65 = 35 points

### Final Score

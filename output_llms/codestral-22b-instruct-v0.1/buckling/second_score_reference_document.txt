### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. However, there are minor deviations in the dimensions and positions of some visual shapes compared to the reference script.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - **5 points** for minor deviations in the dimensions of the visualization shapes (e.g., `boxtruss` and `boxcrank` dimensions).
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly implements the PyChrono API for the most part. However, there is a minor issue with the function name used in the custom function class. The reference uses `GetVal`, while the provided code uses `Get_y`, which is not consistent with the API.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - **10 points** for the incorrect function name which could lead to confusion or errors in function calls.
   - **Total Deductions**: 10 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, with appropriate comments explaining the purpose of various sections. However, some comments could be more descriptive, especially regarding the constraints and their purposes.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - **5 points** for insufficient comments in some areas, particularly around the constraints.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code is efficient and does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows the best practices outlined in the PyChrono documentation.
   - **Deductions**: None.
   - **Total Deductions**: 0 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any explicit error handling mechanisms, which could be beneficial for robustness, especially in a simulation context where various issues may arise.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - **5 points** for the lack of basic error handling.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor issues with the positioning of the camera and the scale of some visual elements compared to the reference script.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - **3 points** for minor visualization issues, such as the camera position and scale of visual elements.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 10 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a total of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 28 points
- Final Score: 100 - 28 = 72

### Final Score Output
[[72]]

### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code is missing the creation of a long box for the rover to cross, which is present in the reference script. This is a significant omission as it affects the simulation environment.
     - **Deduction**: 15 points.
   - **Minor Omissions**: The obstacle is created but lacks specific material properties that could enhance realism.
     - **Deduction**: 5 points.
   - **Total Deductions**: 20 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The `driver.SetSteering(0)` is used instead of `driver.SetSteering(0.0)`, which is a minor inconsistency but does not significantly affect functionality.
     - **Deduction**: 5 points.
   - **Logical Errors**: There are no major logical errors in the code, but the lack of a long box for the rover to cross could lead to unrealistic simulation behavior.
     - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is well-structured and readable, similar to the reference script. However, there are minor differences in comments that could enhance understanding.
     - **Deduction**: 5 points.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: There are no significant inefficiencies in the code compared to the reference script. The code is efficient and follows best practices.
   - **Total Deductions**: 0 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Basic Error Handling**: The code does not include any error handling mechanisms. While this is not explicitly covered in the reference, it is a good practice to include checks for system initialization and other critical operations.
     - **Deduction**: 5 points.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the commented-out shadow feature could enhance the visual quality if enabled.
     - **Deduction**: 2 points.
   - **Total Deductions**: 2 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 20 points
- Correctness: 5 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 20 + 5 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 2 = 37 points
- Final Score: 100 - 37 = 63

### Final Score
[[63]]

### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: 
     - The reference script includes multiple terrain patches with different materials and textures, while the provided script has only four patches with limited variation in textures and properties. This results in a deduction of **15 points** for missing essential details in terrain setup.
   - **Incorrect Configuration**: 
     - The provided script uses a single contact material for all patches, while the reference script uses different materials for each patch. This leads to a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The provided script does not utilize the `veh.RigidTerrain` class's full capabilities, such as specifying different materials for each terrain patch. This leads to a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The terrain initialization and patch setup in the provided script do not match the reference script's approach, which may lead to differences in simulation behavior. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The code is generally well-structured, but there are minor readability issues due to inconsistent spacing and variable naming conventions. This leads to a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Comments**: 
     - The provided script lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of various sections, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 10 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The provided script has some redundant calculations, particularly in the terrain patch setup where the same material properties are repeated. This leads to a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Missing Optimizations**: 
     - There are opportunities for optimization in the way patches are added and configured. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 8 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided script does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are important for robustness. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but it lacks some of the enhancements present in the reference script, such as additional lighting or skybox features. This leads to a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 8 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 25 + 25 + 10 + 8 + 5 + 3 = 76 points
- Final Score: 100 - 76 = 24 points

### Final Score

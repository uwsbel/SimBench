### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

#### Completeness (40 points total)
1. **System Initialization**: The provided code initializes the system correctly using `chrono.ChSystemNSC()`, which is present in the reference script. **(0 points deducted)**
2. **Body Creation**: The particle emitter creates bodies, but it lacks the detailed setup for materials and textures that the reference script includes. The reference script uses a specific material for the sphere and applies textures. **(10 points deducted)**
3. **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is present but lacks some details like the use of a logo and specific lighting configurations that enhance the visual quality. **(5 points deducted)**
4. **Gravitational Force Application**: The gravitational force is applied, but it does not follow the more sophisticated approach of the reference script, which calculates forces based on pairs of bodies. **(10 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Completeness: 35 points**

#### Correctness (30 points total)
1. **API Usage**: The use of `chrono.ChForce` for gravitational force is incorrect as it does not align with the reference script's approach of using pairwise attraction. This could lead to significant differences in simulation behavior. **(15 points deducted)**
2. **Logical Errors**: The random generation of body orientations and velocities is not handled correctly, as it does not ensure valid quaternion normalization or realistic velocity distributions. **(10 points deducted)**
3. **Minor Inaccuracies**: The gravitational force calculation does not account for the gravitational constant or the distance between bodies correctly, which could lead to unrealistic simulation results. **(5 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Correctness: 30 points**

#### Code Quality (10 points total)
1. **Readability and Structure**: The code is relatively well-structured, but variable names could be more descriptive. **(5 points deducted)**
2. **Comments and Documentation**: There are minimal comments explaining the purpose of classes and methods, which makes it harder to understand the code's intent compared to the reference script. **(5 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Code Quality: 10 points**

#### Efficiency (10 points total)
1. **Unnecessary Calculations**: The particle emission and force application could be optimized by avoiding redundant calculations and using more efficient data structures. **(5 points deducted)**
2. **Missing Optimizations**: The reference script uses a more efficient way to handle forces between pairs of bodies, which is not implemented in the provided code. **(3 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Efficiency: 8 points**

#### Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)
1. **Error Handling**: The provided code lacks error handling for potential issues such as invalid body creation or visualization failures. The reference script includes more robust handling of these scenarios. **(5 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points**

#### Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)
1. **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is basic and lacks the advanced features present in the reference script, such as texture application and detailed lighting. **(3 points deducted)**
2. **Minor Visualization Issues**: The lighting setup is not as comprehensive as in the reference script, which could enhance the visual quality. **(2 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 35 points
- Correctness: 30 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 8 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
The total possible score is 100 points. The total deductions amount to 93 points.

**Final Score: 100 - 93 = 7 points**

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **System Initialization**: The provided code initializes the PyChrono system but does not set gravitational acceleration, which is present in the reference script. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Ground Body Creation**: The ground body is created, but it lacks collision handling and visual representation, which is included in the reference. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Pendulum Body Creation**: The pendulum is created but lacks mass and inertia settings, which are crucial for accurate simulation. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is present but lacks additional visual elements like a logo and skybox that enhance the visual experience. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 15 + 10 + 10 + 5 = **40 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **API Usage**: The use of `ChBodyEasySphere` for the pendulum is less appropriate than creating a custom body with mass and inertia settings. This could lead to significant differences in simulation behavior. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Joint Initialization**: The joint is initialized correctly, but the reference uses a more precise frame for the revolute joint. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 15 + 10 = **25 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is relatively readable, but variable names could be more descriptive. The structure is acceptable but lacks comments explaining key components. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The code includes a sleep function to limit frame rate, which is less efficient than using the built-in timing mechanisms in the reference script. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **5 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Basic Error Handling**: The provided code lacks any error handling or checks for the simulation state, which the reference script implicitly handles. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling**: **5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The provided code does not include a logo or skybox, which are present in the reference script. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: **5 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a full score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 40 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = **85 points**
- Final Score: 100 - 85 = **15 points**

### Final Score Output

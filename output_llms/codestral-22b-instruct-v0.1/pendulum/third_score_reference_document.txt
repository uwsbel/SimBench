### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code is mostly complete but has a few minor omissions:
     - The second pendulum's joint initialization uses an incorrect position for the revolute joint (should be at `(2, 0, 1)` instead of `(2, 0, 0)`).
     - The window title in the provided code is "Double Pendulum demo," while the reference uses "Double Pendulum Simulation," which is a minor deviation.
   - **Deductions**: 10 points for the incorrect joint initialization, 5 points for the window title difference.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code uses the PyChrono API correctly in most places. However, the time step in `sys.DoStepDynamics(1e-3)` is inconsistent with the reference script, which uses `1e-2`. This could lead to a significant difference in simulation behavior.
   - **Deductions**: 15 points for the incorrect time step.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names and adequate comments. However, the comments could be more detailed in some areas, particularly around the joint initialization.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. However, the time step could be optimized to match the reference script's approach.
   - **Deductions**: 3 points for not using the same time step as the reference script, which could be more efficient.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks any error handling or robustness checks that could be beneficial, especially in a simulation context.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of basic error handling.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the window title difference is a minor issue.
   - **Deductions**: 2 points for the minor visualization issue (window title).
   - **Total Deductions**: 2 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 15 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a total of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 15 + 15 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 45 points
- Final Score: 100 - 45 = 55

### Final Score

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks the creation of a truss and an end bearing, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **30 points** (15 points for each missing component).
     - The reference script includes a static linear analysis step (`sys.DoStaticLinear()`), which is absent in the provided code. This results in an additional deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: **45 points** (over the maximum, capped at 40 points).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: 
     - The provided code uses `chrono.ChLinkMotorRotationSpeed()` without properly initializing the motor with the correct frames and bodies as done in the reference script. This leads to a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The flywheel is not correctly positioned or aligned as per the reference script, leading to a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The provided code is generally readable, but it lacks meaningful comments and variable names compared to the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The provided code does not optimize the use of visualization tools as effectively as the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code does not set up the visualization as comprehensively as the reference script, particularly in terms of visual shapes and lighting. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: **5 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: **40 points** (capped)
- Correctness: **25 points**
- Code Quality: **5 points**
- Efficiency: **5 points**
- Error Handling and Robustness: **5 points**
- Visualization Tools: **5 points**

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a maximum score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 40 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 85 points
- Final Score: 100 - 85 = 15 points

### Final Score Output

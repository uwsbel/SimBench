### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, visualization, and motor setup. However, there are slight deviations in the initialization of the motor and the use of the motor angle instead of the crank angle for plotting.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for the minor deviation in the motor angle usage for plotting instead of the crank angle.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly initializes the system, bodies, and joints. However, the use of `mcrank.GetRot().Q_to_Euler123().z` for the angle is less direct than using `my_motor.GetMotorAngle()`, which is a more appropriate method to retrieve the motor's angle.
   - **Deductions**: 10 points for the logical error in using the crank's rotation instead of the motor's angle for plotting.
   - **Total Deductions**: 10 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names and adequate comments. However, it could benefit from slightly more detailed comments explaining the purpose of certain sections.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments in some areas.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code is efficient and does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows the reference script closely in terms of API usage.
   - **Deductions**: 0 points.
   - **Total Deductions**: 0 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks explicit error handling mechanisms that could account for potential issues during simulation. The reference script does not explicitly handle errors either, but it does have a more robust closing mechanism for the visualization.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of basic error handling.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the code does not include the closing of the visualization device in a clean manner, which could lead to issues if the simulation is stopped unexpectedly.
   - **Deductions**: 3 points for inadequate visualization setup regarding the closing of the device.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 10 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 5 + 10 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 3 = 28 points
- Final Score: 100 - 28 = 72

### Final Score Output
[[72]]

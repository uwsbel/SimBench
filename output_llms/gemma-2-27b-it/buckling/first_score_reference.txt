### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

#### 1. Completeness (40 points total)
- **Missing Components**: The provided script lacks several components that are present in the reference script:
  - **Custom Function Class**: The reference script uses a custom function for motor angles, which is absent in the provided script. (Deduct 15 points)
  - **Detailed Beam Creation**: The reference script includes a more complex beam creation process with specific parameters and constraints that are not present in the provided script. (Deduct 15 points)
  - **Output Directory**: The reference script defines an output directory for results, which is missing in the provided script. (Deduct 5 points)
  
**Total Deductions for Completeness**: 35 points

#### 2. Correctness (30 points total)
- **Incorrect API Usage**: The provided script uses `chrono.ChForce()` and applies a custom load function, which is not standard practice compared to the reference script's use of motors and constraints. This could lead to significant differences in simulation behavior. (Deduct 15 points)
- **Joint Initialization**: The provided script initializes a fixed constraint incorrectly compared to the reference script's more complex and appropriate constraints. (Deduct 10 points)
  
**Total Deductions for Correctness**: 25 points

#### 3. Code Quality (10 points total)
- **Readability and Structure**: The provided script is relatively straightforward but lacks the structured approach and meaningful variable names seen in the reference script. (Deduct 5 points)
- **Comments**: The provided script has minimal comments compared to the reference script, which is well-documented. (Deduct 5 points)
  
**Total Deductions for Code Quality**: 10 points

#### 4. Efficiency (10 points total)
- **Unnecessary Calculations**: The provided script includes a custom load function that may not be necessary given the context of the simulation, which could be optimized. (Deduct 5 points)
- **Missing Optimization**: The reference script uses a more efficient solver and timestepper, which the provided script does not utilize. (Deduct 3 points)
  
**Total Deductions for Efficiency**: 8 points

#### 5. Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)
- **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided script does not include any error handling or robustness checks, which are present in the reference script. (Deduct 5 points)
  
**Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: 5 points

#### 6. Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)
- **Visualization Setup**: The provided script has a basic visualization setup but lacks the advanced features and enhancements present in the reference script, such as adding a logo, skybox, and camera settings. (Deduct 5 points)
  
**Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: 5 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 35 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 8 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a full score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 35 + 25 + 10 + 8 + 5 + 5 = 88 points
- Final Score: 100 - 88 = 12 points

### Final Score Output

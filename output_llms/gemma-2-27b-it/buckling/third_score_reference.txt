### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks the complete setup for the visualization system, including the addition of a logo, skybox, camera setup, and lighting, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
     - The output directory is set to "BEAM_FAILED" instead of "BEAM_BUCKLING", which is a significant deviation. This results in an additional deduction of **10 points**.
     - The crank motor is initialized as a `ChLinkMotorRotationSpeed` instead of `ChLinkMotorRotationAngle`, which is a critical difference. This results in another deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 15 + 10 + 10 = **35 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: 
     - The use of `SetTorqueFunction` instead of `SetAngleFunction` for the motor is a significant error that could change the simulation behavior. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
     - The dimensions for the visualization shapes and beam sections differ from the reference script, which could lead to incorrect physical representation. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 15 + 10 = **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally readable and well-structured, but there are minor issues with variable naming consistency (e.g., `body_trss` vs. `body_truss`). This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - The comments are present but could be more detailed in certain areas. This results in an additional deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: 5 + 5 = **10 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - There are no significant inefficiencies or redundant calculations present in the provided code compared to the reference script. However, the lack of optimization in the number of elements for the beams compared to the reference script could be considered a minor inefficiency. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **3 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks any error handling or robustness checks that are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is incomplete compared to the reference script, missing elements like the logo, skybox, and proper camera setup. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools**: **5 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 35 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
The total deductions amount to 35 + 25 + 10 + 3 + 5 + 5 = **83 points**. The maximum score is 100, so the final score is calculated as follows:

100 - 83 = **17 points**.

### Final Score

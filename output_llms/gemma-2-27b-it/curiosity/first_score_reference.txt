### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code lacks the creation of a contact material for the ground body, which is present in the reference script. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - The ground body is not fixed in place, which is a significant omission compared to the reference script. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - The reference script includes a rover and a driver, which are entirely absent in the provided code. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 45 points (15 + 15 + 15)

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API (15 points each)**: 
     - The gravity vector is set incorrectly; the reference uses `ChVector3d`, while the provided code uses `ChVectorD`. This could lead to confusion or errors in simulation behavior. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 to 10 points)**: 
     - The code is relatively readable, but it lacks meaningful comments and documentation compared to the reference script. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations or Redundant Code (5 points each)**: 
     - The provided code does not optimize the visualization setup or the simulation loop as effectively as the reference script. However, there are no glaring inefficiencies that warrant a deduction. **(No deductions)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 0 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or robustness checks, which are present in the reference script. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 to 5 points)**: 
     - The visualization setup is minimal compared to the reference script, which includes additional features like textures, skybox, and camera settings. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 45 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 45 + 15 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 5 = 75 points
- Final Score: 100 - 75 = 25 points

### Final Score Output

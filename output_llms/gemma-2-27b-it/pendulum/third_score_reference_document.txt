### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. However, there are minor deviations:
     - The initialization of the revolute joint for the first pendulum is incorrectly positioned (should be at `(0, 0, 1)` instead of `(1, 0, 1)`).
     - The position of the second revolute joint is also incorrect (should be at `(2, 0, 1)` instead of `(2, 0, 0)`).
   - **Deductions**: 10 points for incorrect joint initialization.
   - **Score**: 30 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code uses the PyChrono API correctly in most instances. However, the time step in `sys.DoStepDynamics(1e-3)` is significantly smaller than the reference's `1e-2`, which could lead to performance issues without improving accuracy.
   - **Deductions**: 10 points for the incorrect time step.
   - **Score**: 20 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable. However, it lacks some comments that explain the purpose of certain sections, especially around the initialization of bodies and joints.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments.
   - **Score**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, the smaller time step could lead to unnecessary computations.
   - **Deductions**: 3 points for the inefficient time step.
   - **Score**: 7 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which could be beneficial for robustness, especially in a simulation context.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of error handling.
   - **Score**: 0 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the window title is slightly different from the reference ("Double Pendulum demo" vs. "Double Pendulum Simulation").
   - **Deductions**: 2 points for minor visualization issues.
   - **Score**: 3 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 10 points
- Correctness: 10 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total deductions: 10 + 10 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 35 points
- Final Score: 100 - 35 = 65

### Final Score

### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script, such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. Therefore, no points are deducted here.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code correctly initializes the system, creates bodies, and sets up the motor function. However, there is a minor issue with the gravitational acceleration, which is set to `-3.71` in the reference but is not explicitly stated as a change in the provided code. This could lead to confusion about whether it was intended to match the reference.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted for minor inaccuracies.**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. However, there are some comments that could be more descriptive, especially regarding the purpose of certain sections of the code.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted for insufficient comments.**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit any unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows the reference script closely in terms of efficiency.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks explicit error handling, which is not addressed in the reference script either. However, it does not account for potential issues that could arise during the simulation.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted for lack of basic error handling.**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup in the provided code closely matches the reference script, with appropriate use of the Irrlicht visualization tools. There are no significant issues noted.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points
- Correctness: 5 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 0 points

### Final Score Calculation
Total deductions: 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 points deducted from 100 points.

Final Score: **100 - 15 = 85**

**Final Score Output: [[85]]**

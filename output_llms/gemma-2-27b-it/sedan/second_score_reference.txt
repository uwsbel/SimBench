### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: 
     - The reference script initializes two vehicles, while the provided code initializes them separately but does not create a unified driver system for both vehicles. The reference uses a single driver system for each vehicle, which is more efficient and organized. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
     - The reference script also includes a sinusoidal steering input for both vehicles, which is absent in the provided code. This is a significant omission, leading to another **15 points** deduction.
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of PyChrono API**: 
     - The provided code initializes the second vehicle without using the system of the first vehicle, which is not consistent with the reference script. This could lead to simulation behavior differences, resulting in a **15 points** deduction.
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The provided code does not properly synchronize driver inputs for visualization, as it only uses driver1's inputs for visualization. This is a logical error compared to the reference script, which uses both drivers' inputs. This results in a **10 points** deduction.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The provided code is generally well-structured, but it lacks some comments that would help explain the purpose of certain sections, especially around the vehicle initialization and driver setup. This leads to a **5 points** deduction.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The provided code has some redundancy in setting visualization types for both vehicles separately, which could be optimized. The reference script initializes the second vehicle more efficiently. This results in a **5 points** deduction.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, such as checking if the vehicles are initialized correctly or if the visualization system is set up properly. This leads to a **5 points** deduction.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code does not set up the second vehicle's visualization correctly, as it does not attach it to the visualization system in the same way as the reference script. This results in a **3 points** deduction.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 73 points
- Final Score: 100 - 73 = 27 points

### Final Score Output

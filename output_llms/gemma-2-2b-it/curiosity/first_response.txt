**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Import necessary modules from `pychrono`.
   - Create a `chrono.Application()` object to manage the simulation.
   - Create a `chrono.World()` object to represent the simulation environment.

2. **Adding Physical Systems:**
   - Create a `chrono.Plane()` object representing the ground.
   - Create a `chrono.RigidBody()` object representing the car.
   - Set the initial position, mass, and velocity of the car.

3. **Setting Parameters:**
   - Set the car's material properties (density, friction, elasticity).
   - Add a force to the car using `add_force()`.

4. **Running the Simulation:**
   - Call `app.run()` to start the simulation.

**Key Components:**

- **`chrono.Application()`:** The main application object for managing the simulation.
- **`chrono.World()`:** The simulation environment where objects are placed.
- **`chrono.Plane()`:** A 2D plane object for the ground.
- **`chrono.RigidBody()`:** A 3D rigid body object for the car.
- **`chrono.Vector3()`:** A 3D vector for representing position, velocity, and force.
- **`chrono.Material()`:** A material object defining the properties of the object.
- **`chrono.Inertia()`:** An object representing the inertia of the object.
- **`chrono.Force()`:** An object representing a force applied to the object.

**Customization:**

- You can add more objects (e.g., wheels, engine, etc.) and modify their properties.
- You can add more complex interactions between objects (e.g., collisions, forces, etc.).
- You can adjust the simulation parameters (e.g., time step, gravity, etc.).


**Note:** This is a basic example. You can expand it to create more complex simulations with various physical systems and interactions.

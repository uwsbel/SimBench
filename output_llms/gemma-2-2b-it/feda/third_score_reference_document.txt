### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided script lacks the creation of a sensor manager and the addition of light sources, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points** for each missing essential component (2 components = 30 points).
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The provided script does not include the sensor manager and related camera setup, which could lead to significant differences in simulation behavior. This results in a deduction of **15 points** for the missing sensor manager.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided script is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks comments explaining the purpose of certain sections, particularly around the visualization setup and the simulation loop. This results in a deduction of **5 points** for insufficient comments.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The provided script includes the camera setup inside the simulation loop, which is inefficient as it should only be set up once. This results in a deduction of **5 points** for unnecessary calculations.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided script does not include any error handling mechanisms, which could lead to issues during runtime. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The provided script does not set up the sensor manager and associated lighting as in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points** for inadequate visualization setup.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
- Total Points Deducted: 30 + 15 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 65 points
- Starting Score: 100 points
- Final Score: 100 - 65 = 35 points

### Final Score
[[35]]

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Import necessary libraries: `pychrono`, `pychrono.irrlicht`, `pychrono.tmeasy`.
   - Initialize PyChrono: `chrono.init()`.
   - Create Irrlicht engine: `engine = irr.IrrlichtEngine()`.

2. **Terrain and Vehicle:**
   - Create a `RigidTerrain` object with specified dimensions and texture.
   - Create a `Vehicle` object with initial position, orientation, and contact method.
   - Set the vehicle's tire model to `tmeasy.TMEASYTireModel()`.

3. **Driver System:**
   - Create a `Driver` object to control the vehicle's steering, throttle, and braking.

4. **Simulation Loop:**
   - Set simulation parameters: `dt` (time step) and `fps` (frames per second).
   - Run the simulation loop:
     - Update the driver system.
     - Update the vehicle's dynamics.
     - Render the scene using Irrlicht.
     - Sleep for 1/fps seconds to control the frame rate.

**Note:**

- This script provides a basic framework. You'll need to customize it further based on your specific requirements, such as adding more vehicle components, implementing different control mechanisms, and defining more complex interactions.
- You'll need to install the required libraries: `pychrono`, `pychrono.irrlicht`, and `pychrono.tmeasy`.
- You'll need to create the `terrain.png` texture file.
- You'll need to adjust the simulation parameters (e.g., `dt`, `fps`) to achieve the desired performance.

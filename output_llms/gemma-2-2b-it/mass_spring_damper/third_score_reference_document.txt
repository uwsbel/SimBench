### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code is mostly complete but has some deviations from the reference script.
   - **Missing Essential Components**: The second body (`body_2`) in the provided code is positioned at `(1, -3, 0)` instead of `(-1, -6, 0)` as in the reference. This affects the overall setup of the spring connections.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - Deduct **10 points** for incorrect positioning of `body_2`.
     - Deduct **5 points** for not attaching visualization assets to `spring_1` in the provided code, which is present in the reference.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code has some logical errors in the initialization of springs.
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The initialization of `spring_2` and `spring_3` uses relative positions that do not match the reference script. Specifically, the second spring should connect `body_1` to `body_2` and the third spring should connect `body_2` to `body_3` using the correct relative positions.
   - **Deductions**:
     - Deduct **15 points** for incorrect initialization of springs.
     - Deduct **10 points** for the incorrect relative positions in the spring initialization.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured, but it lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of each section.
   - **Deductions**:
     - Deduct **5 points** for insufficient comments compared to the reference script.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not have significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script.
   - **Deductions**: None.
   - **Total Deductions**: 0 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling or robustness checks.
   - **Deductions**:
     - Deduct **5 points** for lack of error handling.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the absence of visualization for `spring_1` is a notable omission.
   - **Deductions**:
     - Deduct **3 points** for not attaching a visualization asset to `spring_1`.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 15 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 15 + 25 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 3 = 53 points
- Final Score: 100 - 53 = 47

### Final Score Output
[[47]]

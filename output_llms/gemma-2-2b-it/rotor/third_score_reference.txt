### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. However, there are some differences in the motor function implementation.
     - **Missing Essential Component**: The custom motor function in the provided code does not match the reference script in terms of parameters and logic. This is a significant omission as it affects the simulation behavior.
     - **Deduction**: 15 points for the missing essential component in the motor function.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code uses the PyChrono API correctly in most parts, but there are some logical errors:
     - The motor function parameters (A1, A2, T1, T2, T3, w) are different from the reference, which could lead to a significant change in simulation behavior.
     - **Deduction**: 15 points for incorrect use of the motor function.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable. However, the comments could be improved for clarity, especially regarding the motor function.
   - **Deduction**: 5 points for insufficient comments and documentation.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. However, the motor function could be optimized for clarity and efficiency.
   - **Deduction**: 3 points for missing obvious optimization opportunities in the motor function.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are important for robustness.
   - **Deduction**: 5 points for lack of basic error handling.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor differences in the lighting and visual elements compared to the reference script.
   - **Deduction**: 3 points for minor visualization issues.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 15 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 15 + 15 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 3 = 46 points
- Final Score: 100 - 46 = 54

**Final Score**: [[54]]

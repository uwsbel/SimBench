### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided script includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. However, there are some minor deviations:
     - The reference script uses `chrono.ChLinkLockSpherical()` for the joints, while the provided script uses `chrono.ChLinkBallSocket()`, which is not the same type of joint. This could lead to different simulation behaviors.
     - The piston-truss joint in the reference script uses `chrono.ChLinkLockPlanar()`, while the provided script uses `chrono.ChLinkPlanePlane()`, which is also a deviation.
   - **Deductions**: 15 points for incorrect joint types (2 instances) = 30 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided script correctly initializes the system and bodies, but the incorrect use of joint types (as mentioned above) could lead to significant changes in simulation behavior.
   - **Deductions**: 15 points for incorrect use of PyChrono API (joint types).

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally readable and well-structured, but it lacks some comments that explain the purpose of certain sections, especially for joint initialization and visualization setup.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The script does not exhibit any unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows a straightforward structure similar to the reference script.
   - **Deductions**: 0 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The script does not include any error handling mechanisms, such as checking if the visualization system is successfully initialized or if the bodies are correctly added to the system.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of basic error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there is a minor issue with the lighting setup compared to the reference script, which could enhance the visual quality.
   - **Deductions**: 2 points for minor visualization issues.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 15 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 2 = 57 points
- Final Score: 100 - 57 = 43

### Final Score

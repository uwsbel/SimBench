### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, mesh creation, beam section definition, and visualization setup. However, it lacks the finalization of the second beam segment's force application, which is present in the reference script. 
   - **Deductions**: 15 points for missing the force application on the last beam node.
   - **Score**: 25/40

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code uses the PyChrono API correctly in most parts. However, there is a logical error in the way the second beam is created. The reference script applies a force to the last node of the first beam, which is not done in the provided code.
   - **Deductions**: 10 points for the logical error in applying forces.
   - **Score**: 20/30

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, with appropriate comments. However, some comments could be more descriptive, particularly regarding the purpose of certain sections.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments.
   - **Score**: 5/10

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code is efficient and does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows the reference script's structure closely.
   - **Score**: 10/10

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which could lead to issues during execution. The reference script does not explicitly handle errors either, but it is more robust in its setup.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of error handling.
   - **Score**: 0/5

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor differences in how the visual elements are configured compared to the reference script. The provided code does not set the last beam node's force, which impacts visualization.
   - **Deductions**: 3 points for inadequate visualization setup.
   - **Score**: 2/5

### Final Score Calculation
- Completeness: 25/40
- Correctness: 20/30
- Code Quality: 5/10
- Efficiency: 10/10
- Error Handling and Robustness: 0/5
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2/5

**Total Score**: 25 + 20 + 5 + 10 + 0 + 2 = 62

### Final Score Output

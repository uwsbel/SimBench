### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components (15 points each)**:
     - The provided code lacks a custom function class for the motor angle, which is present in the reference script. This is a significant omission as it affects the motor's behavior. **(15 points)**
     - The reference script includes a detailed setup for the FEM mesh and constraints that are not present in the provided code. The absence of these components is critical for the simulation's integrity. **(15 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: **30 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of PyChrono API (15 points each)**:
     - The provided code uses `chrono.ChMotorRotation` incorrectly. The reference script uses `chrono.ChLinkMotorRotationAngle`, which is more appropriate for the intended functionality. **(15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors (10 points)**:
     - The provided code does not set up the constraints between the beams correctly, which is crucial for simulating the interactions between the components. The reference script has a more robust setup. **(10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: **25 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 to 10 points)**:
     - The provided code lacks meaningful comments and documentation compared to the reference script. The reference script is well-structured and includes explanations for each section. **(5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations or Redundant Code (5 points)**:
     - The provided code has some redundant settings, such as setting the gravity multiple times or using unnecessary lambda functions for motor functions. The reference script is more efficient in its approach. **(5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **5 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling (5 points)**:
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or robustness checks, which are present in the reference script. This is a significant oversight. **(5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: **5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 to 5 points)**:
     - The visualization setup in the provided code is less comprehensive than in the reference script. The reference script includes additional visual elements and better camera positioning. **(3 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools**: **3 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 73 points
- Final Score: 100 - 73 = 27

### Final Score Output

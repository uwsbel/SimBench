### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script, such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. However, there is a minor omission in the Rayleigh damping comment where it states "Set Rayleigh damping to 0.0001 for this section" instead of "Set Rayleigh damping to zero for this section" as in the reference. This is a slight deviation.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for minor omissions or slight deviations.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly implements the PyChrono API and does not contain any significant errors that would lead to a change in simulation behavior. However, the comment about Rayleigh damping being set to 0.0001 could lead to confusion as it is not consistent with the reference script's comment.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for minor inaccuracies in comments.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names and appropriate formatting. The comments are generally sufficient, but there could be more detailed explanations in some areas, particularly around the purpose of certain configurations.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments or failure to follow documentation best practices.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It efficiently uses the PyChrono API similar to the reference script. There are no obvious optimization opportunities that are missed.
   - **Deductions**: 0 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any explicit error handling mechanisms. While it may not be strictly necessary for this simulation, the reference script does not address this either, but it is still a point of consideration.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of basic error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup in the provided code is consistent with the reference script. It includes all necessary visual elements and configurations. There are no significant issues with lighting or visualization quality.
   - **Deductions**: 0 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 5 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 0 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 20 points
- Final Score: 100 - 20 = 80

### Final Score Output

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Imports necessary libraries (PyChrono, Irrlicht, NumPy).
   - Initializes the Chrono environment and creates a new system.
   - Sets the Chrono data path (replace with your actual path).

2. **RigidTerrain:**
   - Creates a `ChBodyEasyBox` representing the terrain.
   - Sets its position, size, and makes it fixed.
   - Defines the material properties (friction, restitution).
   - Sets a custom texture for the terrain (replace with your texture path).

3. **FEDA Vehicle:**
   - Creates a `ChBodyEasyBox` for the vehicle body.
   - Sets its initial position and orientation.
   - Makes it a movable body.

4. **Wheels:**
   - Creates four `ChWheelEasy` objects for the vehicle's wheels.
   - Sets their radius, width, and attaches them to the vehicle body.
   - Configures the contact method (e.g., `CM_CYLINDER`) and tire model.

5. **Visualization:**
   - Creates an `ChIrrApp` instance to visualize the simulation using Irrlicht.
   - Adds a camera to the scene and sets its position, target, and initial focus.
   - Sets the simulation timestep to 1/50 seconds for 50 frames per second.

6. **Interactive Driver System:**
   - This part is commented out as it requires additional code to handle user input (keyboard, mouse, etc.) and translate those inputs into forces applied to the vehicle's wheels for steering, throttle, and braking.

7. **Simulation Loop:**
   - Runs the simulation until the user closes the Irrlicht window.
   - In each iteration:
     - Updates the vehicle dynamics using `system.DoStepDynamics()`.
     - Renders the scene using `vis_app.Render()`.



**Remember:**

- Replace placeholder paths with your actual file locations.
- Implement the interactive driver system according to your desired control scheme.
- Adjust vehicle parameters (dimensions, mass, etc.) and tire model properties to match your specific FEDA vehicle.

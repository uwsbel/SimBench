### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code is missing the following essential components:
     - The second pendulum's initial position is set incorrectly (should be at `(3, 0, 1)` instead of `(1.5, 0, 1)`). This is a significant deviation from the reference script. **(15 points deduction)**
     - The color of the second pendulum is set to `(0, 0.6, 0)` instead of `(0, 0, 0.6)`, which is a minor deviation. **(5 points deduction)**
   - Total deductions: **20 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The time step for the simulation is set to `1e-3` instead of `1e-2`, which could lead to a significant change in simulation behavior. **(15 points deduction)**
   - The initialization of the second pendulum's joint is incorrect; it should be initialized at `(2, 0, 1)` instead of `(0, 0, 0)`. **(10 points deduction)**
   - Total deductions: **25 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks some comments that explain the purpose of certain sections, especially regarding the joint initialization. **(5 points deduction)**
   - Total deductions: **5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The time step for the simulation is set to a smaller value than necessary, which may lead to unnecessary computations. The reference script uses a larger time step that is more efficient. **(5 points deduction)**
   - Total deductions: **5 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms or checks for the simulation state, which could lead to issues during execution. The reference script does not explicitly handle errors but is more robust in its setup. **(5 points deduction)**
   - Total deductions: **5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the title of the window is different (`'Double Pendulum demo'` vs. `'Double Pendulum Simulation'`), which is a minor issue. **(2 points deduction)**
   - Total deductions: **2 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 20 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total deductions: 62 points
- Final score: 100 - 62 = 38

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks several essential components present in the reference script:
     - **Mesh Creation**: The reference script initializes a `ChMesh` object, which is crucial for finite element analysis (FEA). The provided code does not create a mesh, which is a significant omission. **(-15 points)**
     - **Material Properties**: The reference script defines material properties for the beam using `ChInertiaCosseratSimple` and `ChElasticityCosseratSimple`, which are not present in the provided code. **(-15 points)**
     - **Gravity Setting**: The reference script sets gravitational acceleration, which is missing in the provided code. **(-15 points)**
     - **Motor Function**: The reference script uses a sine function to control the motor speed, which is absent in the provided code. **(-15 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: **-60 points** (15 points for each of the four missing components)

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: The provided code uses `ChMotorRotation` instead of `ChLinkMotorRotationSpeed`, which is a significant deviation from the reference script. **(-15 points)**
   - **Joint Initialization**: The provided code does not properly initialize the joints between the flywheel and the beam, which is done correctly in the reference script. **(-10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: **-25 points** (15 points for incorrect API usage, 10 points for joint initialization)

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code is relatively readable, but it lacks meaningful comments and documentation compared to the reference script. **(-5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **-5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Redundant Code**: The provided code does not exhibit significant redundancy or inefficiency compared to the reference script. However, it does not utilize the `ChBuilderBeamIGA` tool for beam creation, which is more efficient. **(-3 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **-3 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling or robustness checks, which are present in the reference script. **(-5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: **-5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The provided code initializes a basic visualization but lacks the detailed visualization setup (like adding a logo, skybox, and camera settings) present in the reference script. **(-3 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: **-3 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: **-60 points**
- Correctness: **-25 points**
- Code Quality: **-5 points**
- Efficiency: **-3 points**
- Error Handling and Robustness: **-5 points**
- Use of Visualization Tools: **-3 points**

### Final Score Calculation
Starting with a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: **-60 - 25 - 5 - 3 - 5 - 3 = -101 points**
- Final Score: **0 points** (cannot go below zero)

### Final Score Output

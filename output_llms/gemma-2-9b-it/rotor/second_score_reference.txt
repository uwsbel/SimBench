### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. However, there are minor deviations in comments and variable names compared to the reference script.
   - **Deductions: 5 points** for minor omissions or slight deviations from the reference script.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly uses the PyChrono API for the most part. However, the gravitational acceleration is set to -3.71, which is consistent with the reference script, but the comments suggest it was changed. This could lead to confusion.
   - There are no significant logical errors or incorrect API usage that would lead to a significant change in simulation behavior.
   - **Deductions: 5 points** for minor inaccuracies or unnecessary API calls that deviate from the reference script.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but the comments could be more informative. The variable names are mostly clear, but some could be improved for better understanding.
   - **Deductions: 5 points** for insufficient comments or failure to follow documentation best practices.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows the structure of the reference script closely.
   - **Deductions: 0 points** as there are no significant inefficiencies.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks explicit error handling mechanisms, which could lead to issues during execution. The reference script does not explicitly handle errors either, but it is more robust in its setup.
   - **Deductions: 5 points** for lack of basic error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly consistent with the reference script. However, there are minor differences in the camera position and lighting setup.
   - **Deductions: 3 points** for incorrect or inadequate visualization setup as per the reference script.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 5 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total deductions: 5 + 5 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 3 = 23
- Final score: 100 - 23 = 77

### Final Score Output
[[77]]

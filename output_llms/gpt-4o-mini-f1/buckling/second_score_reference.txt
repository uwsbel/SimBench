### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script, such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. No essential components are missing.
   - **Deductions:** 0 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly uses the PyChrono API in most instances. However, there are a few areas where the configuration could lead to differences in simulation behavior:
     - The `SetConstrainedCoords` method is used correctly, but the constraints could be more explicitly defined to match the reference script's intent.
     - The `SetAutomaticGravity` method is set to `False`, which is consistent with the reference but may not be necessary depending on the simulation context.
   - **Deductions:** 5 points for minor inaccuracies in joint initialization.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names and appropriate comments. However, there are some areas where comments could be more descriptive, particularly in sections where the purpose of certain calculations or configurations is not immediately clear.
   - **Deductions:** 5 points for insufficient comments in some areas.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not contain any significant inefficiencies or redundant calculations compared to the reference script. It follows a logical flow and uses the APIs effectively.
   - **Deductions:** 0 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The code lacks explicit error handling mechanisms that could enhance robustness, such as checks for successful initialization of bodies or constraints.
   - **Deductions:** 5 points for lack of basic error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly consistent with the reference script. However, there are minor differences in the configuration of visual elements, such as the camera position and the addition of visual shapes.
   - **Deductions:** 3 points for minor visualization issues.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points
- Correctness: 5 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Total points deducted: 0 + 5 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 3 = 18 points

Starting from a total of 100 points:
100 - 18 = 82 points

### Final Score
[[82]] 

This score reflects a well-structured and mostly correct implementation with some minor issues in correctness, comments, error handling, and visualization setup.

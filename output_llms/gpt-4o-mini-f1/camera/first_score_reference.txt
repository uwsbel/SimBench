### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks the addition of point lights for scene illumination, which is present in the reference script. This is essential for rendering the scene properly. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - The reference script includes a detailed setup for the mesh body, including scaling and visual shape creation, which is not present in the provided code. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The provided code uses `chrono.ChBodyEasyMesh()` which is not the same as creating a body and attaching a visual shape as done in the reference. This could lead to differences in how the mesh is rendered and interacted with in the simulation. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The camera's orbit parameters are set differently (radius and speed) compared to the reference script, which may affect the simulation's intended behavior. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The provided code is relatively straightforward but lacks the structured approach seen in the reference script, which is organized into a main function. This affects readability and maintainability. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Comments**: 
     - The provided code has minimal comments compared to the reference script, which is well-documented. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 10 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The provided code does not appear to have significant inefficiencies, but it lacks optimizations present in the reference script, such as the use of a structured main function and better organization of the simulation loop. **(Deduct 3 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the success of operations, which is a basic requirement for robustness. The reference script includes more comprehensive handling of potential issues. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code lacks the detailed visualization setup seen in the reference script, such as the use of area lights and proper visualization filters. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 25 + 10 + 3 + 5 + 5 = 78 points
- Final Score: 100 - 78 = 22 points

### Final Score Output

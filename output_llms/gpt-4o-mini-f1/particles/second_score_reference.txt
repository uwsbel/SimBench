### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script, such as system initialization, body creation, visualization, and particle emitter setup. Therefore, there are no deductions in this category.
   - **Score: 40/40**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly uses the PyChrono API in most instances. However, there is a potential issue with the gravitational constant being modified (`G_constant = 6.674e-3`). While this is not necessarily incorrect, it deviates from the reference script, which uses the standard gravitational constant without modification. This could lead to significant changes in simulation behavior.
   - There are no logical errors or incorrect settings of body properties compared to the reference script.
   - **Deductions: 15 points for the modified gravitational constant.**
   - **Score: 15/30**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names and appropriate formatting. However, it lacks comments that explain the purpose of certain sections, which the reference script does better.
   - **Deductions: 5 points for insufficient comments.**
   - **Score: 5/10**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code appears to be efficient, with no unnecessary calculations or redundant code. However, there is a minor inefficiency in the way forces are accumulated in the loop, which could be optimized by directly applying forces without recalculating positions multiple times.
   - **Deductions: 3 points for missing optimization opportunities.**
   - **Score: 7/10**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which could lead to issues if unexpected conditions arise during simulation. The reference script does not explicitly handle errors either, but it is generally good practice to include basic error handling.
   - **Deductions: 5 points for lack of basic error handling.**
   - **Score: 0/5**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct and matches the reference script. However, there could be minor improvements in lighting or camera angles, but these are not significant enough to warrant a major deduction.
   - **Deductions: 2 points for minor visualization issues.**
   - **Score: 3/5**

### Final Score Calculation
- Completeness: 40/40
- Correctness: 15/30
- Code Quality: 5/10
- Efficiency: 7/10
- Error Handling and Robustness: 0/5
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3/5

**Total Score: 70/100**

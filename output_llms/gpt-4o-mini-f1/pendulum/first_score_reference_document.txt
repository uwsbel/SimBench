### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The provided code does not set the gravitational acceleration for the simulation, which is a critical aspect of most physical simulations. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
     - The ground body is not fixed, which is a significant omission since the ground should not move in a pendulum simulation. This results in an additional deduction of **10 points**.
     - The pendulum's inertia tensor is set incorrectly compared to the reference script, which uses a different value. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: **35 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The pendulum's inertia tensor is set to `(0.1, 0.1, 0.1)` instead of `(0.2, 1, 1)`, which could significantly affect the simulation's behavior. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The joint initialization uses `chrono.ChFramed(chrono.ChVector3d(0, 0, 0), chrono.QUNIT)` instead of the reference's `chrono.ChFramed(chrono.ChVector3d(0, 0, 1), chrono.ChQuaterniond(1, 0, 0, 0))`, which could lead to incorrect joint behavior. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The code is relatively readable, but it lacks meaningful comments explaining the purpose of each section, which is present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The code logs the pendulum's position and velocity every iteration, which may not be necessary for all simulations. However, this is a minor issue compared to the reference script's logging strategy. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for simulation conditions, which could lead to issues during runtime. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: 
     - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but it lacks the addition of visual shapes for the pendulum and ground, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: **35 points**
- Correctness: **25 points**
- Code Quality: **5 points**
- Efficiency: **5 points**
- Error Handling and Robustness: **5 points**
- Use of Visualization Tools: **3 points**

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 35 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = **78 points**
- Final Score: 100 - 78 = **22 points**

### Final Score Output

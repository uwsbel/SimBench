### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code lacks the definition of beam properties such as width, height, Young's modulus, and shear modulus, which are critical for defining the beam's physical characteristics. This is a significant omission. **(15 points)**
     - The provided code does not include the application of forces or torques to the nodes, which is present in the reference script. **(15 points)**
     - The provided code does not include constraints to connect nodes to a fixed body, which is essential for simulating realistic behavior. **(15 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 45 points (exceeds the maximum, capped at 40 points).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of PyChrono API (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code uses `chrono.ChSolver.Type_BARZILAIB`, which is not the same as the MKL solver used in the reference. This could lead to significant differences in simulation behavior. **(15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors (10 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not set the automatic gravity for FEA elements, which is handled in the reference script. This could lead to unintended simulation results. **(10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 to 10 points)**: 
     - The provided code is relatively readable, but it lacks comments that explain the purpose of various sections, which are present in the reference script. **(5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations or Redundant Code (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not include optimizations present in the reference script, such as the use of a dedicated solver. **(5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: 5 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks that might be necessary for robustness, unlike the reference script. **(5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 to 5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not visualize the nodes or apply the same level of detail in visualization as the reference script. **(3 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: 3 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting with a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 40 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 83 points
- Final Score: 100 - 83 = 17 points

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. Therefore, there are no deductions in this category.
   - **Score: 40**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code appears to use the PyChrono API correctly in most instances. However, there are a few areas where the configuration could lead to different simulation behavior:
     - The `SetAutomaticGravity(False)` method is used, which is correct, but the reference does not explicitly mention this as a critical point. This could be considered a minor deviation.
     - The `SetConstrainedCoords` method is used correctly, but the specific constraints could be more clearly aligned with the reference.
   - Overall, there are no significant errors, but minor inaccuracies lead to a deduction.
   - **Score: 25 (5 points deduction)**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names and appropriate comments. However, there are a few areas where comments could be more descriptive, especially regarding the purpose of certain parameters.
   - **Score: 8 (2 points deduction)**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code is efficient and does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. However, there is a minor opportunity for optimization in the way some vectors are initialized and used, which could be streamlined.
   - **Score: 8 (2 points deduction)**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The code lacks explicit error handling mechanisms, such as checks for successful initialization of bodies or constraints. The reference script may include more robust handling of potential issues.
   - **Score: 0 (5 points deduction)**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor issues with the lighting setup and the camera position that could be improved for better visualization.
   - **Score: 3 (2 points deduction)**

### Final Score Calculation
- Completeness: 40
- Correctness: 25
- Code Quality: 8
- Efficiency: 8
- Error Handling and Robustness: 0
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3

**Total Score: 40 + 25 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 3 = 84**

### Final Score Output

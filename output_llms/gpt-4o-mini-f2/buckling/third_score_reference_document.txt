### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code is mostly complete but has some deviations from the reference script. 
     - The motor type is different (`ChLinkMotorRotationSpeed` vs. `ChLinkMotorRotationAngle`), which is a significant difference in functionality. **(Deduct 10 points)**
     - The output directory name is different (`BEAM_FAILED` vs. `BEAM_BUCKLING`). **(Deduct 5 points)**
     - The dimensions of the visualization shapes differ slightly, which could affect the visual representation. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 20 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The motor's torque function is set instead of the angle function, which could lead to significant changes in simulation behavior. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors**: The parameters for the beam sections and constraints differ from the reference, which could affect the simulation results. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured and readable, but there are some minor issues with variable naming consistency and spacing. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Comments**: The comments are adequate but could be improved for clarity in some sections. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 10 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: There are no significant inefficiencies noted, but the code could be optimized in terms of the number of elements in the beam construction. **(Deduct 3 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Error Handling**: There is no explicit error handling in the code, which could lead to issues during execution. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the window title and size differ from the reference. **(Deduct 3 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points.

### Summary of Deductions

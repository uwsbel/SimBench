### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script, such as system initialization, vehicle creation, and visualization setup. 
   - **Deductions**: 0 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code uses the PyChrono API correctly, and there are no significant changes in simulation behavior compared to the reference script. 
   - However, the `vehicle.GetSystem().SetCollisionSystemType(chrono.ChCollisionSystem.Type_BULLET)` line is present in both scripts, but it is not mentioned in the reference script's comments, which could imply a lack of clarity in its necessity.
   - **Deductions**: 0 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is structured well, with appropriate use of classes and methods. However, it lacks comments explaining the purpose of certain blocks, which would enhance readability and maintainability.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code is efficient and does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows the reference script closely in terms of efficiency.
   - **Deductions**: 0 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The code does not include any explicit error handling mechanisms. While the simulation may run without issues, it would benefit from checks or try-except blocks to handle potential runtime errors.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is adequate and mirrors the reference script closely. There are no significant issues with the visualization tools used.
   - **Deductions**: 0 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points
- Correctness: 0 points
- Code Quality: -5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: -5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 0 points

### Final Score Calculation
Total points deducted: 10 points (5 for code quality + 5 for error handling)

Final score: 50 points (out of 100)

### Final Score Output

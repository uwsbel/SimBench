**Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code**

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script, such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. Therefore, no points are deducted in this category.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The use of the PyChrono API appears to be correct, and there are no significant changes in simulation behavior due to incorrect API usage. However, the pendulum's initial angular velocity is set using `SetPosDt`, which is typically used for setting linear velocity rather than angular velocity. This is a logical error.
   - **Score: 10 points deducted**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names and appropriate comments. It follows good documentation practices similar to the reference script. No points are deducted in this category.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not show any unnecessary calculations or redundant code compared to the reference script. It appears to be efficient and optimized. No points are deducted in this category.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The code lacks explicit error handling or checks for potential issues that could arise during simulation. The reference script does not explicitly show error handling either, but it is generally good practice to include it. However, since both scripts are similar in this regard, I will not deduct points.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is consistent with the reference script, including the addition of a logo, skybox, camera, and lights. There are no significant issues in this area. No points are deducted.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted**

**Final Score Calculation:**
- Total deductions: 10 points (from Correctness)
- Total score: 50 points (out of 100)

**Final Score Output:**
[[90]] 

**Explanation of Deductions:**
- A deduction of 10 points was made for the logical error in setting the pendulum's initial angular velocity using `SetPosDt`, which is not the correct method for that purpose. All other aspects of the code were found to be complete, correct, and well-structured, leading to a final score of 90.

### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script, such as system initialization, body creation, and sensor setup. Therefore, no points are deducted in this category.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The script sets the mass of the `mesh_body` and `ground_body` to 0, which makes them static. This is inconsistent with the comment indicating that the body should be movable. This could lead to confusion regarding the intended behavior of the simulation.
   - The rotational velocity applied to the `ground_body` is set to a small value, which may not be significant enough to observe sensor motion effectively.
   - **Score: 10 points deducted for logical errors (incorrect body properties).**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names and adequate comments explaining each section. However, there are some minor areas where additional comments could enhance understanding, especially regarding the purpose of certain configurations.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted for minor improvements in documentation.**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code appears efficient and does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows the reference script closely in terms of API usage.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The script lacks explicit error handling for potential issues, such as file loading or sensor initialization failures. The reference script does not handle these either, but it is a good practice to include basic error handling.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted for lack of error handling.**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is consistent with the reference script, including the addition of point lights and visual shapes. There are no significant issues in this area.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points
- Correctness: 10 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 0 points

### Final Score Calculation
Total deductions: 10 + 5 + 5 = 20 points

The maximum score is 100 points. Thus, the final score is:
\[100 - 20 = 80\]

### Final Score

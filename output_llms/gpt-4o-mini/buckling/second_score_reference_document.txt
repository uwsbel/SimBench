### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script, such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. However, there are minor deviations in comments and naming conventions. 
   - **Deductions**: 0 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly implements the PyChrono API, with no significant errors in the use of functions or initialization of bodies and joints. However, there are slight differences in the configuration of some parameters (e.g., the number of elements in the beam).
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for minor inaccuracies.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is structured well and is mostly readable. However, there are some areas where comments could be improved for clarity, and variable names could be more descriptive.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code appears efficient and does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows the reference script closely in terms of efficiency.
   - **Deductions**: 0 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The code lacks explicit error handling mechanisms, which could be beneficial for robustness, especially in a simulation context.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of basic error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly aligned with the reference script. However, there are minor differences in the lighting and camera setup that could enhance the visualization.
   - **Deductions**: 2 points for minor visualization issues.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points
- Correctness: 5 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
- Total Points: 100
- Deductions: 17 points
- Final Score: 100 - 17 = 83

### Final Score Output

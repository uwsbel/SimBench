Below is a Python script that sets up a PyChrono simulation of a FEDA vehicle on a rigid terrain, following the instructions provided. This script initializes the environment, adds the necessary components, and configures the simulation parameters.

```python
import pychrono.core as chrono
import pychrono.irrlicht as chronoirr
import pychrono.vehicle as chrono_vehicle

# Initialize the PyChrono environment
chrono.ChSystem.Set_G_acc(chrono.ChVectorD(0, -9.81, 0))  # Set gravity

# Create the simulation system
system = chrono.ChSystem()

# Create a RigidTerrain
terrain = chrono_vehicle.ChRigidTerrain(system)
terrain.SetContactFrictionCoefficient(0.8)
terrain.SetContactRestitutionCoefficient(0.1)

# Load a custom texture for the terrain
terrain.SetTexture(chrono.GetChronoDataPath() + "terrain_texture.jpg")

# Create the FEDA vehicle
vehicle = chrono_vehicle.FEDA_Vehicle("FEDA_Vehicle")
vehicle.Initialize(chrono.ChCoordsysD(chrono.ChVectorD(0, 0.5, 0), chrono.ChQuaternionD(1, 0, 0, 0)))

# Set the vehicle's parameters
vehicle.SetContactMethod(chrono.ChMaterialSurface.SMC)  # Set contact method
vehicle.SetTireModel(chrono_vehicle.ChTireModelType.SIMPLE)  # Set tire model

# Add the vehicle to the system
system.Add(vehicle)

# Set up the Irrlicht visualization
application = chronoirr.ChIrrApp(system, "FEDA Vehicle Simulation", chronoirr.dimension2d(800, 600))
application.AddTypicalSky()
application.AddTypicalLights()
application.AddTypicalCamera(chronoirr.vector3df(0, 2, -5), chronoirr.vector3df(0, 0, 0))

# Set the camera to follow the vehicle
camera = application.GetCamera()
camera.setTarget(chronoirr.vector3df(0, 0, 0))
camera.setPosition(chronoirr.vector3df(0, 2, -5))

# Set the simulation loop parameters
application.SetTimestep(1 / 50.0)  # 50 frames per second

# Main simulation loop
while application.GetDevice().run():
    application.BeginScene()
    application.DrawAll()
    
    # Update vehicle dynamics
    vehicle.Update()
    
    # Render the scene
    application.EndScene()

# Clean up and exit
application.GetDevice().drop()
```

### Explanation of the Script:
1. **Initialization**: The script initializes the PyChrono environment and sets gravity.
2. **Rigid Terrain**: A rigid terrain is created with a custom texture, and contact properties are set.
3. **Vehicle Setup**: A FEDA vehicle is created and initialized with specific parameters, including its position and orientation.
4. **Visualization**: The Irrlicht visualization is set up, including a sky, lights, and a camera that follows the vehicle.
5. **Simulation Loop**: The main loop runs at 50 frames per second, updating the vehicle dynamics and rendering the scene in real time.

### Note:
- Ensure that the necessary PyChrono and Irrlicht libraries are installed and properly configured in your Python environment.
- Replace `"terrain_texture.jpg"` with the actual path to your texture file.
- Adjust the vehicle model and parameters as needed based on your specific requirements.

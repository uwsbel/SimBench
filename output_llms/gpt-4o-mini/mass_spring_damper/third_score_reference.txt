### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, spring creation, and visualization setup. However, there are some minor deviations:
     - The positions of `body_2` and `body_3` are different from the reference script. This could be considered a minor omission or deviation.
     - The visualization asset for the springs is added in the provided code but not in the same manner as in the reference script, which could be seen as a minor detail.
   - **Deductions: 5 points** for minor deviations in body positions and visualization setup.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code uses the PyChrono API correctly overall, but there are logical errors:
     - The initialization of `spring_2` and `spring_3` uses incorrect body references. In the reference script, `spring_2` connects `body_1` to `body_2`, and `spring_3` connects `body_2` to `body_3`, but the provided code incorrectly initializes these springs.
   - **Deductions: 15 points** for incorrect use of the PyChrono API in spring initialization.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally readable and well-structured, with meaningful variable names. However, it lacks comments explaining the purpose of each section, which the reference script provides.
   - **Deductions: 5 points** for insufficient comments and documentation.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not exhibit any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. Both scripts perform similar operations without unnecessary calculations.
   - **Deductions: 0 points** for efficiency.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which is a basic requirement for robustness. The reference script does not explicitly show error handling either, but it is more robust in its structure.
   - **Deductions: 5 points** for lack of error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup in the provided code is mostly correct, but the title of the window is different from the reference script, which could be considered a minor issue.
   - **Deductions: 2 points** for minor visualization issues (window title difference).

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a full score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 5 + 15 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 2 = 32
- Final Score: 100 - 32 = 68

**Final Score: [[68]]**

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code initializes the PyChrono system and sets up visualization, but it lacks several components present in the reference script:
     - **Missing Particle Emitter**: The reference script uses a `ChParticleEmitter`, which is not present in the provided code. (Deduct 15 points)
     - **Missing Texture and Material Setup**: The reference script applies textures and materials to the bodies, which is absent in the provided code. (Deduct 15 points)
     - **Collision System Setup**: The reference script specifies a collision system type (BULLET), which is not configured in the provided code. (Deduct 15 points)
   - Total deductions for completeness: **45 points** (capped at 40 points).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code uses gravitational force calculations that are not as robust as the reference script, which uses combinations to apply forces between pairs of bodies. This could lead to inaccuracies in the simulation. (Deduct 15 points)
   - The gravitational constant is set to a different value in the provided code compared to the reference script. (Deduct 10 points)
   - Total deductions for correctness: **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks meaningful comments and documentation, making it less readable compared to the reference script. (Deduct 5 points)
   - The structure is somewhat clear, but variable names could be improved for better understanding. (Deduct 5 points)
   - Total deductions for code quality: **10 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code calculates gravitational forces in a nested loop without using combinations, which is less efficient than the reference script. (Deduct 5 points)
   - There are no significant optimizations present in the provided code compared to the reference script. (Deduct 3 points)
   - Total deductions for efficiency: **8 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are present in the reference script. (Deduct 5 points)
   - Total deductions for error handling and robustness: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup in the provided code is basic and lacks some features present in the reference script, such as logo and skybox setup. (Deduct 3 points)
   - Total deductions for visualization tools: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 8 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from 100 points:
- Total deductions: 40 + 25 + 10 + 8 + 5 + 3 = 91 points
- Final score: 100 - 91 = 9 points

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code initializes the PyChrono system and sets up visualization, but it lacks several essential components present in the reference script:
     - **Missing Particle Emitter**: The reference code uses a `ChParticleEmitter`, which is not present in the provided code. This is a significant omission. **(-15 points)**
     - **Collision System Type**: The reference code specifies the collision system type as `Type_BULLET`, which is not set in the provided code. **(-10 points)**
     - **Material Properties**: The reference code defines contact materials for the bodies, which is missing in the provided code. **(-10 points)**
     - **Texture and Visual Shape**: The reference code applies textures to the visual shapes, which is not done in the provided code. **(-5 points)**
   - Total deductions: **(-50 points)**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code has several incorrect uses of the PyChrono API:
     - **Gravitational Constant**: The gravitational constant is set to `1.0`, which is not realistic and differs from the reference code's use of a modified gravitational constant (`6.674e-3`). This could lead to significant differences in simulation behavior. **(-15 points)**
     - **Force Calculation**: The force calculation in the `apply_gravitational_forces` function is not as robust as in the reference code, which uses combinations of bodies to calculate forces. **(-10 points)**
   - Total deductions: **(-25 points)**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks sufficient comments and documentation compared to the reference code, which is well-structured and documented. **(-5 points)**
   - The readability is acceptable, but variable names could be more descriptive. **(-5 points)**
   - Total deductions: **(-10 points)**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code uses a nested loop to apply gravitational forces, which is less efficient than the combination approach used in the reference code. **(-5 points)**
   - There are no significant optimization opportunities identified, but the overall structure could be improved for efficiency. **(-3 points)**
   - Total deductions: **(-8 points)**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for edge cases, such as division by zero in the gravitational force calculation. The reference code handles these aspects more robustly. **(-5 points)**
   - Total deductions: **(-5 points)**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup in the provided code is basic and lacks some features present in the reference code, such as adding a logo and a skybox. **(-3 points)**
   - Total deductions: **(-3 points)**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: **(-50 points)**
- Correctness: **(-25 points)**
- Code Quality: **(-10 points)**
- Efficiency: **(-8 points)**
- Error Handling and Robustness: **(-5 points)**
- Use of Visualization Tools: **(-3 points)**

### Final Score Calculation
The maximum score is 100 points. After applying the deductions:
- Total deductions: **(-101 points)**
- Final score: **0 points** (the score cannot go below zero)

### Final Score Output

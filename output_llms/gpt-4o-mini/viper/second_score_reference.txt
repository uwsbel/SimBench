### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script, such as system initialization, body creation, visualization, and sensor setup. 
   - However, the order of some components differs from the reference script, which could be seen as a minor deviation. 
   - **Deductions:** 5 points for slight deviations in the order of components.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly uses the PyChrono API for the most part, but there is a minor issue with the initialization of the sensor manager and the camera sensor. The reference script initializes the sensor manager before adding the point light, while the provided code does it afterward. This could lead to potential issues in the rendering order or sensor updates.
   - **Deductions:** 5 points for minor inaccuracies in the order of initialization.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. However, there are some areas where comments could be improved for clarity, especially around the sensor setup and rendering logic.
   - **Deductions:** 5 points for insufficient comments.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code is efficient and does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows the reference script closely in terms of efficiency.
   - **Deductions:** 0 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks explicit error handling mechanisms, which could be important for robustness, especially in a simulation context where unexpected behaviors may occur.
   - **Deductions:** 5 points for lack of basic error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the commented-out shadow feature could be seen as a missed opportunity for better visual quality, as the reference script does not comment it out.
   - **Deductions:** 3 points for inadequate visualization setup.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 5 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 5 + 5 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 3 = 23
- Final Score: 100 - 23 = 77

### Final Score Output
[[77]]

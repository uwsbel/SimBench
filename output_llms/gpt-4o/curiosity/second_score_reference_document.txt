### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code is mostly complete but has some discrepancies compared to the reference script:
     - The ground material type is `ChMaterialSurfaceNSC` in the provided code, while the reference uses `ChContactMaterialNSC`. This is a significant difference as it may affect the contact properties. **(Deduct 10 points)**
     - The obstacle is created with a different size and material texture compared to the reference. The reference uses a blue texture, while the provided code uses a concrete texture. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - Total deductions: **15 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code uses `Set_G_acc` instead of `SetGravitationalAcceleration`, which is an incorrect API call. This could lead to issues in simulation behavior. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - The `SetBodyFixed` method is used correctly in both scripts, so no deduction here.
   - Total deductions: **15 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks some comments that could clarify the purpose of certain sections, especially around the initialization of the rover and the visualization setup. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - Total deductions: **5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not have any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. Both scripts perform similar operations in the simulation loop. No deductions here.
   - Total deductions: **0 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - There is no explicit error handling in the provided code, which is a concern for robustness. The reference script does not handle errors either, but it is generally a good practice to include basic error handling. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - Total deductions: **5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly similar, but the provided code does not include the `EnableShadows()` function, which is commented out in the reference. This could enhance the visual quality of the simulation. **(Deduct 3 points)**
   - Total deductions: **3 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 15 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total deductions: 15 + 15 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 3 = 43 points
- Final score: 100 - 43 = 57

### Final Score
[[57]]

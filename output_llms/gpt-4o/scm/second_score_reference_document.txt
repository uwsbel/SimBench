### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: 
     - The reference script uses a class `SCMParameters` to encapsulate terrain parameters, while the provided script uses a standalone class `SCMTerrainParameters`. This is a deviation from the reference script's structure, leading to a deduction of **15 points**.
     - The terrain initialization in the reference script is done with a method that sets parameters directly from the `SCMParameters` class, while the provided script initializes parameters separately and then sets them. This is less efficient and less clear, leading to another **10 points** deduction.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The provided script uses `chrono.ChVectorD` and `chrono.ChQuaternionD`, while the reference script uses `chrono.ChVector3d` and `chrono.ChQuaterniond`. This inconsistency could lead to confusion or errors in the context of the simulation, resulting in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The terrain initialization parameters in the provided script do not match the reference script's parameters for the "hard" terrain, which could lead to different simulation behaviors. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The provided script is generally well-structured, but the naming conventions (e.g., `SCMTerrainParameters` vs. `SCMParameters`) could lead to confusion. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Comments and Documentation**: 
     - The provided script lacks sufficient comments compared to the reference script, which explains the purpose of various sections and parameters. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 10 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The provided script initializes terrain parameters in a less efficient manner than the reference script, which directly sets parameters from the class. This leads to a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Missing Optimization Opportunities**: 
     - The provided script does not utilize the `InitializeParametersAsMid` method from the reference script, which could streamline the initialization process. This results in another **3 points** deduction.
   - **Total Deductions**: 8 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling**: 
     - The provided script does not include any error handling for invalid terrain configurations, while the reference script does. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided script has a similar setup to the reference script but lacks some minor visual enhancements (e.g., `AddTypicalLights`). This leads to a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 8 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
The total deductions amount to **76 points** from a maximum of **100 points**.

**Final Score**: 100 - 76 = **24 points**

### Final Score Output

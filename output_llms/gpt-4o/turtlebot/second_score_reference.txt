### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, ground body creation, robot creation, and visualization setup. However, there are some minor deviations:
     - The ground material type is different (`ChMaterialSurfaceNSC` vs. `ChContactMaterialNSC`), which could affect the simulation. **(Deduct 5 points)**
     - The ground body is fixed using `SetBodyFixed(True)` instead of `SetFixed(True)`, which is a minor difference but still a deviation. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions: 10 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code uses `SetMotorSpeed(math.pi, ...)` for straight movement, while the reference uses `SetMotorSpeed(-math.pi, ...)`. This could lead to a significant difference in the robot's movement direction. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - The left and right turn speeds are also different, which could affect the robot's turning behavior. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions: 25 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks some comments that could enhance understanding, especially around the movement function. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions: 5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, the movement function could be optimized by defining the wheel IDs outside the function to avoid redefining them on each call. **(Deduct 3 points)**
   - **Total Deductions: 3 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code raises a `ValueError` for invalid modes, which is good. However, it does not account for potential issues with the robot initialization or visualization setup. **(Deduct 3 points)**
   - **Total Deductions: 3 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the print statements in the simulation loop could be considered as a minor distraction from the visualization. **(Deduct 2 points)**
   - **Total Deductions: 2 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 10 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 3 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 10 + 25 + 5 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 48 points
- Final Score: 100 - 48 = 52

**Final Score: [[52]]**

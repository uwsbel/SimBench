### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks the detailed lidar sensor configuration found in the reference script, such as the lidar's vertical field of view settings and the return mode. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
     - The initial position of the robot is set differently in the provided code compared to the reference script, which may affect the simulation's intended behavior. This results in an additional deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The method `Set_G_acc` is incorrectly used instead of `SetGravitationalAcceleration`, leading to a significant change in simulation behavior. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The robot's motor speeds are set to positive values for 'straight' movement, which may not align with the intended direction of movement. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The code is reasonably structured, but it lacks comments explaining the purpose of certain blocks, especially around sensor configuration and the simulation loop. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The random box generation could be optimized by predefining the box size and reusing it instead of creating a new `ChVector3d` for each box. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not handle potential errors in the `move` function, such as invalid mode inputs. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code has a basic visualization setup, but it does not include the advanced lidar visualization filters and settings present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 25 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 68 points
- Final Score: 100 - 68 = 32 points

### Final Score Output

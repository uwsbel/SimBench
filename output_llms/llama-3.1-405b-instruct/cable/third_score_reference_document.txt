### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: The provided code is mostly complete, but it lacks the creation of visual shapes for the hinge and the boxes, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Minor Omissions**: The `PrintBodyPositions` method in the provided code lacks a time print statement, which is present in the reference. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 + 5 = **20 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The provided code uses `chrono.ChBody()` instead of `chrono.ChBodyEasyBox()` for creating boxes, which is less efficient and not aligned with the reference. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: The force applied to the beam nodes is significantly different in magnitude compared to the reference script. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 + 10 = **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code is generally well-structured, but the variable names and comments could be improved for clarity. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The provided code has some redundancy in the way it initializes bodies and constraints compared to the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are not explicitly present in the reference but are generally good practice. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The provided code does not include visual shapes for the hinge and boxes, which are present in the reference. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 20 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 20 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = **65 points**
- Final Score: 100 - 65 = **35 points**

### Final Score Output

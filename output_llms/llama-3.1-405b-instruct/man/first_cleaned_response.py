It seems like there are no instructions provided. Please provide the instructions, and I'll be happy to help you generate a simulation script using PyChrono.

Once you provide the instructions, I'll make sure to:

1. Initialize the PyChrono environment and core components.
2. Add the required physical systems and objects as specified.
3. Set necessary default parameters such as positions, forces, and interactions.

Please provide the instructions, and I'll get started on creating the simulation script.

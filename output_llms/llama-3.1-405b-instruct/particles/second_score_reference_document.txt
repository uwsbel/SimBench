### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script, such as system initialization, body creation, visualization, and particle emitter setup. Therefore, no points are deducted here.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The gravitational constant is defined correctly, and the calculation of kinetic and potential energy is mostly accurate. However, there is a minor logical error in the potential energy calculation where the potential energy is incorrectly accumulated using `+=` instead of `-=` in the loop. This could lead to an incorrect total energy calculation.
   - Additionally, the variable `velocity` should be obtained using `body.GetPos_dt()` instead of `body.GetPos_dt()`, which is a minor but important detail.
   - **Score: 10 points deducted for logical errors.**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. However, there are some minor comments missing that could enhance understanding, especially in complex sections like energy calculations.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted for insufficient comments.**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code could be optimized by avoiding the repeated calculation of `D_attract` and `r_attract` in the energy calculation loop. This is a minor inefficiency compared to the reference script.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted for unnecessary calculations.**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks any error handling or checks for potential issues, such as division by zero when calculating gravitational attraction. The reference script does not explicitly handle this either, but it is a common practice to include such checks.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted for lack of error handling.**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is correctly implemented, matching the reference script. There are no significant issues in this area.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points deducted
- Correctness: 10 points deducted
- Code Quality: 5 points deducted
- Efficiency: 5 points deducted
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points deducted
- Use of Visualization Tools: 0 points deducted

### Final Score Calculation
Total deductions: 10 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 25 points

Starting from 100 points: 
100 - 25 = 75 points

### Final Score
[[75]]

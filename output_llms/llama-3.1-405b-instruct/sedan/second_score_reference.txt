### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The reference script initializes two vehicles, while the provided code initializes them separately but does not create a second driver system correctly. The second vehicle is initialized but lacks a dedicated driver system, which is essential for controlling it. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
     - The reference script uses `ChDriver` for the vehicles, while the provided code uses `ChInteractiveDriverIRR`, which is not consistent with the reference. This could lead to differences in control behavior. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: 
     - The provided code uses `driver1.GetInputs()` and `driver2.GetInputs()` but does not properly set the steering and throttle inputs for the second vehicle. The reference script sets these inputs directly on the driver objects. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The sinusoidal steering input is applied to both vehicles, but the reference script applies a different steering input to each vehicle, which is a logical error in simulating the intended behavior. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The provided code is generally well-structured, but it lacks comments explaining the purpose of certain blocks of code, especially around the driver input handling. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The provided code has redundant calls to `GetInputs()` for both drivers, which could be optimized by directly setting the inputs on the driver objects as shown in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, such as checking for successful initialization of vehicles or the visualization system. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code does not attach the second vehicle to the visualization system, which is a significant oversight compared to the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 70 points
- Final Score: 100 - 70 = 30

### Final Score Output

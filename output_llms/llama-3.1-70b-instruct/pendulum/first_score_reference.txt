### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code lacks the initialization of gravitational acceleration, which is present in the reference script. **(15 points deduction)**
     - The reference script includes a visualization cylinder for the ground and pendulum, which is missing in the provided code. **(15 points deduction)**
   - **Incorrect Configuration (10 points)**: 
     - The pendulum's mass and inertia settings differ from the reference script, which could lead to different simulation behaviors. **(10 points deduction)**
   - **Minor Omissions (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not include a simulation loop or logging of the pendulum's position and velocity, which are present in the reference script. **(5 points deduction)**

   **Total Deductions for Completeness: 15 + 15 + 10 + 5 = 45 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Use (15 points)**: 
     - The revolute joint initialization in the provided code uses a different coordinate system and orientation than in the reference script, which could significantly alter the simulation behavior. **(15 points deduction)**
   - **Logical Errors (10 points)**: 
     - The pendulum's mass and inertia settings are not aligned with the reference script, leading to potential inaccuracies in simulation dynamics. **(10 points deduction)**
   - **Minor Inaccuracies (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code has redundant calls to `AddCameraMotionMode`, which is unnecessary and deviates from the reference script. **(5 points deduction)**

   **Total Deductions for Correctness: 15 + 10 + 5 = 30 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 to 10 points)**: 
     - The provided code has poor readability due to excessive repetition of `AddCameraMotionMode`, which makes it difficult to follow. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Insufficient Comments (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code lacks meaningful comments explaining the purpose of various sections, unlike the reference script. **(5 points deduction)**

   **Total Deductions for Code Quality: 5 + 5 = 10 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations (5 points)**: 
     - The repeated calls to `AddCameraMotionMode` are inefficient and not needed, leading to a deduction. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Missing Optimization Opportunities (3 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not utilize the `ChBodyEasyBox` for creating bodies, which could simplify the code. **(3 points deduction)**

   **Total Deductions for Efficiency: 5 + 3 = 8 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for potential issues, which the reference script addresses. **(5 points deduction)**

   **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Visualization Setup (3 to 5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not set up visual elements like the logo or skybox, which are present in the reference script. **(5 points deduction)**

   **Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points**

### Final Score Calculation
- Total Deductions: 45 (Completeness) + 30 (Correctness) + 10 (Code Quality) + 8 (Efficiency) + 5 (Error Handling) + 5 (Visualization) = 103 points
- Maximum Score: 100 points
- Final Score: 100 - 103 = -3 (capped at 0)

### Final Score Output

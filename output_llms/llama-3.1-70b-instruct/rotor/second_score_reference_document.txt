### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script, such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. Therefore, no points are deducted in this category.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code has a few inaccuracies:
     - The value of `CH_PI` is incorrectly set to a more precise value (3.14159265358979323846) compared to the reference (3.1456). While this is a minor error, it could lead to discrepancies in calculations.
     - The calculation for `node_mid` is corrected in the provided code, but it uses `int(builder.GetLastBeamNodes().size() / 2.0)` instead of `m.floor(...)`, which is a logical error.
   - **Score: 15 points deducted for incorrect use of `CH_PI`, and 10 points deducted for logical error in `node_mid` calculation. Total: 25 points deducted**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable. However, there are some minor issues with comments and variable naming that could be improved for clarity.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted for minor readability issues and insufficient comments. Total: 5 points deducted**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, the use of `int(...)` for `node_mid` could be seen as less efficient than using `m.floor(...)`.
   - **Score: 3 points deducted for minor inefficiency in `node_mid` calculation. Total: 3 points deducted**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks explicit error handling mechanisms that could enhance robustness, such as checks for successful initialization of bodies or joints.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted for lack of error handling. Total: 5 points deducted**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct and mirrors the reference script. However, there are minor differences in the setup of visual elements that could be optimized.
   - **Score: 2 points deducted for minor visualization issues. Total: 2 points deducted**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points deducted
- Correctness: 25 points deducted
- Code Quality: 5 points deducted
- Efficiency: 3 points deducted
- Error Handling: 5 points deducted
- Visualization: 2 points deducted

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total deductions: 0 + 25 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 40 points deducted
- Final score: 100 - 40 = 60

**Final Score: [[60]]**

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks several essential components present in the reference script:
     - **Collision System**: The reference script sets a collision system type, which is missing in the provided code. **(-15 points)**
     - **Contact Material**: The reference script creates a contact material for the ground, which is not done in the provided code. **(-15 points)**
     - **Texture for Ground**: The reference script applies a texture to the ground, which is absent in the provided code. **(-5 points)**
     - **Initialization of the Robot**: The reference script initializes the robot after creation, which is not done in the provided code. **(-10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: **-45 points** (exceeds the maximum deduction, capped at 40 points).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The provided code uses `SetMotorTorque` instead of `SetMotorSpeed`, which is incorrect for controlling the Turtlebot's motors. **(-15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors**: The robot's initial position and orientation are not set correctly compared to the reference script. **(-10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: **-25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code is relatively readable but lacks meaningful comments and variable names compared to the reference script. **(-5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **-5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The provided code has a simple simulation loop that could be optimized, but it does not have significant inefficiencies compared to the reference. **(-3 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **-3 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling or robustness checks, which are present in the reference script. **(-5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: **-5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The provided code sets up visualization but lacks some features present in the reference script, such as a logo and skybox. **(-3 points)**
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: **-3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: **-40 points** (capped)
- Correctness: **-25 points**
- Code Quality: **-5 points**
- Efficiency: **-3 points**
- Error Handling and Robustness: **-5 points**
- Use of Visualization Tools: **-3 points**

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: **-40 - 25 - 5 - 3 - 5 - 3 = -81**
- Final Score: **100 - 81 = 19**

### Final Score Output

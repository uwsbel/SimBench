### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks several essential components present in the reference script:
     - **Custom Function Class**: The reference script defines a custom function class for motor angle, which is absent in the provided code. (Deduct 15 points)
     - **Body Creation and Initialization**: The provided code does not create various bodies (e.g., truss, crank) and their visual shapes as done in the reference script. (Deduct 15 points)
     - **FEM Mesh Setup**: The provided code does not create a FEM mesh or define beam properties, which are crucial for the simulation. (Deduct 15 points)
     - **Visualization Setup**: The provided code lacks a comprehensive visualization setup, including the creation of the Irrlicht visualization system and the addition of visual elements. (Deduct 15 points)
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 = **60 points** (but capped at 40 points for this section).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The provided code uses `chrono.ChBeam2D`, which is not a standard class in the PyChrono library, leading to potential errors in simulation behavior. (Deduct 15 points)
   - **Logical Errors**: The provided code does not initialize or configure bodies and constraints correctly, which could lead to incorrect simulation results. (Deduct 10 points)
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 + 10 = **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code lacks meaningful variable names and is poorly structured, making it difficult to follow. (Deduct 5 points)
   - **Comments**: There are insufficient comments in the provided code to explain the logic or purpose of the code sections. (Deduct 5 points)
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 + 5 = **10 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The provided code does not optimize the creation of bodies or constraints, leading to potential inefficiencies. (Deduct 5 points)
   - **Missing Optimizations**: The reference script implements several optimizations that are not present in the provided code. (Deduct 3 points)
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 + 3 = **8 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are important for robustness. (Deduct 5 points)
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The provided code does not set up visualization tools correctly, missing many elements present in the reference script. (Deduct 5 points)
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 8 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a total of 100 points:
- Deductions: 40 + 25 + 10 + 8 + 5 + 5 = 93 points
- Final Score: 100 - 93 = **7 points**

### Final Score Output

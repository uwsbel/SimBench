### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization. However, it lacks the explicit setting of the solver in the system, which is present in the reference script. 
   - **Deductions**: 15 points for missing the line `sys.SetSolver(solver)`.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly initializes the system and applies forces. However, it does not explicitly set the solver type in the system, which could lead to confusion or incorrect behavior during simulation.
   - **Deductions**: 10 points for not setting the solver in the system.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is well-structured and readable, with appropriate comments explaining each section. However, there are minor formatting inconsistencies, such as spacing around comments and code blocks.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for minor readability issues.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code is efficient and does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows the best practices for using the PyChrono API.
   - **Deductions**: 0 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The code does not include any error handling mechanisms or checks for the success of operations, which could lead to issues if something goes wrong during execution.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but it lacks the setting of the solver type in the system, which is important for proper visualization and simulation behavior.
   - **Deductions**: 3 points for not setting the solver type in the visualization context.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: -15 points
- Correctness: -10 points
- Code Quality: -5 points
- Efficiency: -0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: -5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: -3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- 100 - 15 - 10 - 5 - 5 - 3 = 62

Thus, the final score for the provided PyChrono code is:

[[62]]

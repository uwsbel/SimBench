### Evaluation of the Double Pendulum Simulation Script

#### Completeness (40 points total)
- **System Initialization**: The script correctly initializes the Chrono simulation system and sets gravitational acceleration. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Body Creation**: Both pendulum bodies and the ground body are created and configured properly. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Visualization Setup**: The visualization system is set up with a window, camera, and lighting. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Joint Creation**: The revolute joints connecting the pendulums and the ground are created correctly. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Logging**: The logging mechanism is present but could be improved by allowing for more flexible logging options. **(5 points deducted for minor omissions)**

**Total Deductions for Completeness: 5 points**

#### Correctness (30 points total)
- **API Usage**: The API is used correctly for creating bodies, joints, and visualization. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Logical Errors**: The initialization of the revolute joints is correct, and the pendulum positions are set appropriately. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Minor Inaccuracies**: The use of `chrono.ChFramed` for joint initialization is correct, but the frame could be better defined to ensure the joints operate as intended. **(5 points deducted for minor inaccuracies)**

**Total Deductions for Correctness: 5 points**

#### Code Quality (10 points total)
- **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Comments**: While there are some comments, they could be more detailed to explain the purpose of each section and the reasoning behind specific choices. **(5 points deducted for insufficient comments)**

**Total Deductions for Code Quality: 5 points**

#### Efficiency (10 points total)
- **Unnecessary Calculations**: The code does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. **(0 points deducted)**
- **Optimization Opportunities**: The simulation step is set to a fixed time step, which is acceptable, but there could be a mechanism to adjust the time step based on simulation performance. **(3 points deducted for missing optimization opportunities)**

**Total Deductions for Efficiency: 3 points**

#### Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)
- **Basic Error Handling**: There is no error handling present in the code, which could lead to issues if the simulation encounters unexpected conditions. **(5 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points**

#### Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)
- **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the addition of a skybox and logo could be improved for better aesthetics. **(2 points deducted for minor visualization issues)**

**Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points**

### Final Score Calculation
- **Total Deductions**: 5 (Completeness) + 5 (Correctness) + 5 (Code Quality) + 3 (Efficiency) + 5 (Error Handling) + 2 (Visualization) = 25 points
- **Final Score**: 100 - 25 = 75

### Final Score Output
[[75]]

### Brief Explanation of Deductions
- Minor omissions in logging and comments led to a deduction in completeness and code quality.
- A minor inaccuracy in joint initialization and a lack of error handling contributed to deductions in correctness and robustness.
- Some optimization opportunities were missed, and minor visualization issues were noted, leading to additional deductions.

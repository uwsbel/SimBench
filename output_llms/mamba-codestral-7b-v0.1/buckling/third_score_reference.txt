### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code lacks the complete setup for the vertical beam and the crank beam, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points** for each missing beam setup.
     - The output directory is set to "BEAM_FAILED" instead of "BEAM_BUCKLING," which is a significant deviation. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 (vertical beam) + 15 (crank beam) + 5 (output directory) = **35 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API (15 points each)**: 
     - The motor is initialized as a `ChLinkMotorRotationSpeed` instead of `ChLinkMotorRotationAngle`, which is a significant change in behavior. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
     - The visualization shape for the truss has incorrect dimensions compared to the reference. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 (motor type) + 10 (visual shape dimensions) = **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 to 10 points)**: 
     - The code is generally readable, but the lack of consistent formatting and some variable names could be improved. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Comments and Documentation (5 points)**: 
     - While there are comments, they are not as detailed as in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 (readability) + 5 (comments) = **10 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations (5 points each)**: 
     - The code does not optimize the number of elements in the beam construction compared to the reference. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 to 5 points)**: 
     - The visualization setup is incomplete compared to the reference script, particularly in the use of visual shapes and the camera setup. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 35 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 35 + 25 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 85 points
- Final Score: 100 - 85 = **15 points**

### Final Score Output

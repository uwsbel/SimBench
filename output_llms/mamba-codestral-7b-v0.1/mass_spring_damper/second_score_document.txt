### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **System Initialization**: The system is initialized correctly using `chrono.ChSystemNSC()`. (0 points deducted)
   - **Body Creation**: Bodies are created for the ground and two dynamic bodies, and they are added to the system. (0 points deducted)
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization system is initialized and configured properly. (0 points deducted)
   - **Spring Initialization**: The springs are initialized and added to the system. However, the second spring is defined twice, which is unnecessary. (10 points deducted for redundancy)
   - **Total Deductions**: 10 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **API Usage**: The API is used correctly for most parts. However, the second spring is initialized twice, which could lead to confusion and unintended behavior. (15 points deducted for incorrect use)
   - **Logical Errors**: The spring force function is defined but not used correctly in the second spring initialization. (10 points deducted for logical error)
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks comments explaining the purpose of various sections. (5 points deducted)
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Redundant Code**: The second spring is defined twice, which is redundant. (5 points deducted)
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Error Handling**: There is no error handling or checks for potential issues (e.g., checking if bodies are added successfully). (5 points deducted)
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there could be improvements in lighting or camera positioning for better visibility. (2 points deducted)
   - **Total Deductions**: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
- **Initial Score**: 100
- **Total Deductions**: 10 (Completeness) + 25 (Correctness) + 5 (Code Quality) + 5 (Efficiency) + 5 (Error Handling) + 2 (Visualization) = 52
- **Final Score**: 100 - 52 = 48

### Final Score Output
[[48]] 

### Summary of Deductions
- **Completeness**: 10 points for redundancy in spring initialization.
- **Correctness**: 25 points for incorrect usage of the API and logical errors.
- **Code Quality**: 5 points for lack of comments.
- **Efficiency**: 5 points for redundant code.
- **Error Handling**: 5 points for lack of error handling.
- **Visualization**: 2 points for minor visualization issues.

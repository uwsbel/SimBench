### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. However, there is a discrepancy in the visualization shape for the ground. The reference uses a sphere with a radius of 0.2, while the provided code uses a sphere with a radius of 2. This is a significant deviation in terms of intended visual representation.
   - **Deductions**: 10 points for incorrect configuration of the ground visualization shape.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code correctly initializes the pendulum and the spherical joint. However, there is a logical error in the use of `pend_1.SetWvel_loc()` instead of `pend_1.SetPosDt()` for setting the initial angular velocity. This could lead to a significant change in the simulation behavior.
   - **Deductions**: 15 points for incorrect use of the API regarding the initial angular velocity.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. However, there are some comments that could be more descriptive, particularly regarding the purpose of certain settings and configurations.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The simulation loop uses a time step of `1e-3`, which is consistent with the reference script. However, the reference script uses a time step of `1e-2` for the `sys.DoStepDynamics()`, which is more efficient for the simulation's purpose. The provided code could benefit from this optimization.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for not optimizing the time step.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms or checks for potential issues during the simulation. The reference script does not explicitly handle errors either, but it is generally good practice to include basic checks.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the use of the ground shape is inconsistent with the reference. The provided code uses a sphere with a radius of 2, while the reference uses a sphere with a radius of 0.2. This discrepancy affects the visual representation.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for incorrect visualization setup.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: -10 points
- Correctness: -15 points
- Code Quality: -5 points
- Efficiency: -5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: -5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: -5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 45 points
- Final Score: 100 - 45 = 55

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. However, there are some discrepancies:
     - The second pendulum's color is different from the reference script (red vs. blue). This is a minor deviation. **(5 points deduction)**
     - The initial position of the second pendulum is set to (2, 0, 1) instead of (3, 0, 1) as in the reference. This is a significant deviation. **(10 points deduction)**
     - The joint initialization for the second pendulum is incorrect; it should be initialized at (2, 0, 1) instead of (0, 0, 1). **(10 points deduction)**
   - Total deductions: **25 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The use of the PyChrono API is mostly correct, but there are logical errors:
     - The time step for `sys.DoStepDynamics` is set to `1e-3` instead of `1e-2`, which could lead to different simulation behavior. **(10 points deduction)**
     - The joint initialization for the second pendulum is incorrect, as mentioned above. **(10 points deduction)**
   - Total deductions: **20 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. However, there are some comments that could be improved for clarity:
     - The comments do not consistently explain the purpose of each section or the significance of certain parameters. **(5 points deduction)**
   - Total deductions: **5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit any unnecessary calculations or redundant code. However, the time step could be optimized to match the reference script's settings. **(3 points deduction)**
   - Total deductions: **3 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The code lacks any error handling or robustness checks, which are not present in the reference script either. **(5 points deduction)**
   - Total deductions: **5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the window title differs slightly from the reference script. **(2 points deduction)**
   - Total deductions: **2 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 20 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from 100 points:
- Total deductions: 25 + 20 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 60 points
- Final score: 100 - 60 = 40 points

### Final Score

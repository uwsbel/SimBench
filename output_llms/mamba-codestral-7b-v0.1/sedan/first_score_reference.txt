### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code lacks a vehicle system and terrain setup, which are essential components present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **30 points** (2 components).
   - **Minor Omissions (5 points each)**: 
     - The provided code does not include visualization setup for the simulation, which is present in the reference. This results in an additional deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: **35 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code uses `system.DoStaticLinear()` and `system.DoDynamic()`, which are not appropriate for the intended simulation of a vehicle and terrain. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors (10 points)**: 
     - The lack of vehicle initialization and terrain interaction leads to logical errors in the simulation. This results in an additional deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: **25 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 to 10 points)**: 
     - The provided code is relatively straightforward but lacks comments and meaningful variable names that would enhance readability. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: **5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations or Redundant Code (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not utilize efficient methods for vehicle simulation and lacks optimizations present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: **5 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or robustness checks, which are important for a simulation. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: **5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 to 5 points)**: 
     - The provided code lacks any visualization setup, which is crucial for understanding the simulation. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: **5 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 35 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 35 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 80 points
- Final Score: 100 - 80 = 20 points

### Final Score

### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. However, it lacks the detailed motor speed settings for the Turtlebot, which are crucial for accurate movement control. The reference script uses specific speed values for different modes, while the provided script uses a generic speed of `1` for straight movement and `-1` for turning, which may not accurately reflect the intended behavior. 
   - **Deductions**: 10 points for missing important details in the motor control setup.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code has a logical error in the `move` function where the motor speeds are set incorrectly. The reference script uses specific values for different movements (e.g., `-math.pi` for straight movement), while the provided script uses `1` and `-1`, which may not correspond to the same speed or direction. This could lead to significant differences in simulation behavior.
   - **Deductions**: 15 points for incorrect use of motor speed settings.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of the `move` function and the simulation loop. The reference script provides better documentation and clarity.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code has a minor inefficiency in the way it checks for time conditions to trigger movement. The reference script uses a more straightforward approach by checking ranges (e.g., `if time < 5.0:`) instead of using absolute comparisons. This could lead to unnecessary complexity.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for unnecessary complexity in time checks.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code raises a `ValueError` for invalid modes in the `move` function, which is good practice. However, it does not handle edge cases where the robot might not be initialized correctly or if the simulation encounters unexpected states.
   - **Deductions**: 3 points for inadequate handling of edge cases.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the provided code does not include the `vis.EnableShadows()` line, which is present in the reference script and enhances the visual quality of the simulation.
   - **Deductions**: 3 points for missing shadow enablement.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 10 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling: 3 points
- Visualization: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- 100 - (10 + 15 + 5 + 5 + 3 + 3) = 100 - 41 = 59

**Final Score**: [[59]]

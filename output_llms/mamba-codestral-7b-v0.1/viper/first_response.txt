Sure, here's a basic script that should get you started with your simulation. Please note that this is a simplified version and you may need to adjust it to fit your specific needs.

```python
import pychrono

# Initialize the PyChrono environment and core components
system = pychrono.ChSystemSMC()

# Add the required physical systems and objects
ground_body = pychrono.ChBodyEasyBox(10, 0.1, 10, 1000, True, False)
ground_body.SetPos(pychrono.ChVectorD(0, -0.1, 0))
system.AddBody(ground_body)

viper_rover = pychrono.ChBodyEasyBox(1, 1, 1, 1000, True, False)
viper_rover.SetPos(pychrono.ChVectorD(0, 0.1, 0))
system.AddBody(viper_rover)

# Set necessary default parameters such as positions, forces, and interactions
viper_rover.SetPos_x(0)
viper_rover.SetPos_y(0.1)
viper_rover.SetPos_z(0)

# Initialize the Viper rover and its driver
# This part is highly dependent on the specifics of your rover and driver models

# Create a real-time visualization using Irrlicht with camera settings and lighting
# This part is highly dependent on the specifics of your visualization setup

# Implement a simulation loop where the rover's steering gradually changes over a specified time period
# This part is highly dependent on the specifics of your simulation loop and steering control

# Update and render the rover at each timestep
# This part is highly dependent on the specifics of your visualization setup

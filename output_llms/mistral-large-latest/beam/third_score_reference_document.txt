### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, mesh creation, beam section definition, node and element addition, force application, and visualization setup. Therefore, no points are deducted in this category.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code uses `chrono.ChFrameD` instead of `chrono.ChFrame` or `chrono.ChFramed`, which is a minor inconsistency but does not significantly affect the simulation behavior. 
   - The `SetSectionRotation` method uses `chrono.CH_C_DEG_TO_RAD`, which is correct, but the reference uses `chrono.CH_RAD_TO_DEG`. This is a minor inconsistency but does not affect the simulation.
   - The `SetFEMdataType` method uses `chrono.ChVisualShapeFEA.DataType.ELEM_BEAM_MZ`, while the reference uses `chrono.ChVisualShapeFEA.DataType_ELEM_BEAM_MZ`. This is a minor inconsistency.
   - **Score: 10 points deducted for minor inaccuracies.**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable. However, there are minor formatting inconsistencies, such as spacing around commas and inconsistent use of semicolons at the end of lines. The comments are adequate but could be more descriptive in some areas.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted for minor readability issues.**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code is efficient and does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows the reference script closely in terms of API usage. There are no obvious optimization opportunities missed.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which could be beneficial for robustness, especially in a simulation context where various issues may arise.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted for lack of error handling.**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor discrepancies in the method calls and parameters compared to the reference script. The use of `SetFEMdataType` and `SetFEMglyphType` is slightly different, which could lead to visualization issues.
   - **Score: 3 points deducted for minor visualization issues.**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points deducted
- Correctness: 10 points deducted
- Code Quality: 5 points deducted
- Efficiency: 0 points deducted
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points deducted
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points deducted

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a total of 100 points:
- 0 (Completeness) 
- 10 (Correctness) 
- 5 (Code Quality) 
- 0 (Efficiency) 
- 5 (Error Handling) 
- 3 (Visualization)

Total deductions: 23 points.

Final score: **100 - 23 = 77**

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks a proper collision system setup (e.g., `sys.SetCollisionSystemType(...)`), which is present in the reference script. This is a significant omission.
     - **Deduction**: 15 points
   - **Visualization Details**: The visualization setup is less comprehensive than in the reference script. For instance, the reference script includes texture application and a more detailed camera setup.
     - **Deduction**: 10 points
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The gravitational force calculation does not account for the direction correctly in the provided code. The reference script uses a more accurate method for calculating forces between particles.
     - **Deduction**: 15 points
   - **Logical Errors**: The custom timestepper does not reset the forces on each iteration, which could lead to incorrect force accumulation.
     - **Deduction**: 10 points
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally readable, but the lack of comments explaining the purpose of functions and key sections detracts from its quality.
     - **Deduction**: 5 points
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The gravitational force calculation is performed in a nested loop without optimization, which could be improved by using combinations as in the reference script.
     - **Deduction**: 5 points
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for edge cases (e.g., division by zero in gravitational calculations).
     - **Deduction**: 5 points
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is less detailed than in the reference script, lacking texture application and specific lighting configurations.
     - **Deduction**: 3 points
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 25 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 68 points
- Final Score: 100 - 68 = 32

### Final Score
[[32]]

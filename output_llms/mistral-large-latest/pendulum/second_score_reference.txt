### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code is mostly complete but has some discrepancies:
     - The gravitational acceleration method is incorrectly named (`Set_G_acc` instead of `SetGravitationalAcceleration`). **(10 points deduction)**
     - The visualization shape for the ground is incorrectly defined as a cylinder instead of a sphere. **(10 points deduction)**
     - The pendulum body is added using `sys.Add(pend_1)` instead of `sys.AddBody(pend_1)`. **(5 points deduction)**
     - The joint is initialized with `chrono.ChLinkLockSpherical()` instead of `chrono.ChLinkMateSpherical()`. **(5 points deduction)**
     - The time step in `sys.DoStepDynamics(1e-3)` is inconsistent with the reference script's `1e-2`. **(5 points deduction)**
   - Total deductions for completeness: **45 points** (capped at 40).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The use of `SetWvel_par` for setting the initial angular velocity is incorrect; it should be `SetPosDt`. **(15 points deduction)**
   - The joint initialization is incorrect; it should use `chrono.ChLinkMateSpherical()` instead of `chrono.ChLinkLockSpherical()`. **(10 points deduction)**
   - Total deductions for correctness: **25 points** (capped at 30).

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured, but there are some issues:
     - Variable names are consistent, but some comments could be clearer or more descriptive. **(5 points deduction)**
   - Total deductions for code quality: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script, but the time step in `DoStepDynamics` could be optimized to match the reference. **(3 points deduction)**
   - Total deductions for efficiency: **3 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The code lacks any error handling or checks for potential issues, which the reference script may handle better. **(5 points deduction)**
   - Total deductions for error handling: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the ground visualization shape is incorrect. **(3 points deduction)**
   - Total deductions for visualization tools: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a total of 100 points:
- Total deductions: 40 + 25 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 3 = 81 points
- Final score: 100 - 81 = 19

### Final Score Output

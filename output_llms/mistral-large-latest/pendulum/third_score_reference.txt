### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code is missing the `sys.SetGravitationalAcceleration` method, which is present in the reference script as `sys.Set_G_acc`. This is a significant omission since it affects the simulation's behavior. 
     - The reference script uses `sys.AddBody` instead of `sys.Add`, which is a more appropriate method for adding bodies. This is a minor but important detail.
     - The reference script uses `chrono.ChFramed` and `chrono.ChVector3d` instead of `chrono.ChFrameD` and `chrono.ChVectorD`, which is a deviation in the type used for frames and vectors.
   - **Incorrect Configuration (10 points)**: 
     - The visualization shapes and their configurations are mostly correct, but the reference script uses `chrono.ChFramed` for visual shapes, which is more appropriate than `chrono.ChFrameD`.
   - **Minor Omissions (5 points)**: 
     - The window title in the provided code is "Double Pendulum," while the reference script uses "Double Pendulum Simulation," which is a minor deviation.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 + 10 + 5 = **30 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Use (15 points)**: 
     - The provided code uses `Set_G_acc` instead of `SetGravitationalAcceleration`, which is incorrect and could lead to confusion.
   - **Logical Errors (10 points)**: 
     - The initialization of the revolute joints uses `chrono.ChFrameD` instead of `chrono.ChFramed`, which could lead to issues in the simulation.
   - **Minor Inaccuracies (5 points)**: 
     - The use of `GetPos_dt` instead of `GetPosDt` for linear velocity retrieval is a minor inaccuracy.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 + 10 + 5 = **30 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 points)**: 
     - The code is generally well-structured, but the variable naming conventions could be improved for clarity. For example, using `cyl_1` and `cyl_2` could be more descriptive.
   - **Comments (5 points)**: 
     - The comments are adequate but could be more detailed in explaining the purpose of certain blocks of code.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 + 5 = **10 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations (5 points)**: 
     - The time step in `sys.DoStepDynamics(1e-3)` is smaller than in the reference script (`1e-2`), which may lead to unnecessary computations without significant benefits.
   - **Missing Optimizations (3 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not utilize some optimizations present in the reference script, such as better handling of visual shapes.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 + 3 = **8 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling (5 points)**: 
     - The provided code lacks any error handling or checks that might be present in the reference script, which could lead to issues during execution.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Visualization Setup (3 points)**: 
     - The provided code does not use the same visualization setup as the reference script, particularly in how visual shapes are added and configured.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 30 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 8 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 30 + 10 + 8 + 5 + 3 = 86 points
- Final Score: 100 - 86 = **14 points**

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components found in the reference script. There are no missing components. 
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The use of the PyChrono API appears to be correct, and there are no significant changes in simulation behavior due to incorrect API usage.
   - There are no logical errors or incorrect settings of body properties compared to the reference script.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names and consistent formatting.
   - However, there are slightly fewer comments compared to the reference script, which could enhance understanding.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted.**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code is efficient and does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. However, there is a minor opportunity for optimization in the way the rendering is handled.
   - **Score: 3 points deducted.**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks explicit error handling mechanisms that could account for potential issues during simulation, which the reference script may handle better.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted.**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor issues with the lighting setup that could be improved for better visual quality.
   - **Score: 3 points deducted.**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points
- Correctness: 0 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Total deductions: 5 + 3 + 5 + 3 = 16 points

Total score: 100 - 16 = 84

**Final Score: [[84]]**

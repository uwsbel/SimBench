### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The terrain is created using `veh.SCMDeformableTerrain` in the provided code, while the reference uses `veh.SCMTerrain`. This indicates a potential mismatch in the terrain type, which could affect simulation behavior. **(Deduct 10 points)**
     - The reference script includes a call to `terrain.SetPlotType(...)`, which is missing in the provided code. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The terrain initialization parameters differ between the two scripts. The reference uses a different mesh resolution and dimensions, which could significantly affect simulation accuracy. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The reference script initializes the terrain with a different vertical position (`-0.5` vs. `-1`), which could lead to differences in simulation results. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The provided code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks comments explaining the purpose of certain parameters (e.g., terrain parameters). **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The provided code does not include any unnecessary calculations or redundant code. However, it could optimize the terrain initialization by using the same parameters as the reference. **(Deduct 3 points for missing optimization opportunities)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, such as checking if the visualization system initializes correctly. The reference does not explicitly handle errors either, but it is a common best practice. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: 
     - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the title of the window in the provided code mentions "Deformable terrain," while the reference mentions "Rigid terrain," which could mislead users about the simulation type. **(Deduct 3 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 15 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 56 points
- Final Score: 100 - 56 = 44 points

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

#### 1. Completeness (40 points total)
- **Missing Essential Components**: The script includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. No deductions here.
- **Configuration Details**: The configuration of bodies and constraints appears to be correct and follows the API documentation. No deductions here.
- **Minor Omissions**: There are no significant omissions in the setup. No deductions here.

**Score: 40/40**

#### 2. Correctness (30 points total)
- **Incorrect Use of API**: The use of `chrono.ChSystemSMC()` is appropriate for the simulation type. No deductions here.
- **Logical Errors**: The initialization of motors, constraints, and bodies seems logical and follows best practices. No deductions here.
- **Minor Inaccuracies**: There are no significant inaccuracies or unnecessary API calls. No deductions here.

**Score: 30/30**

#### 3. Code Quality (10 points total)
- **Readability and Structure**: The code is well-structured and easy to read. Variable names are meaningful, and the overall flow is logical. No deductions here.
- **Comments**: The code includes comments that explain the purpose of various sections and functions, which is good practice. No deductions here.

**Score: 10/10**

#### 4. Efficiency (10 points total)
- **Unnecessary Calculations**: There are no unnecessary calculations or redundant code present. No deductions here.
- **Optimization Opportunities**: The code appears to be efficient and does not have obvious optimization opportunities that are missed. No deductions here.

**Score: 10/10**

#### 5. Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)
- **Basic Error Handling**: The script lacks explicit error handling mechanisms (e.g., try-except blocks) to manage potential runtime errors. This is a significant omission.
- **Edge Cases**: There is no handling for edge cases, such as invalid input parameters or simulation failures.

**Score: 0/5** (5 points deducted)

#### 6. Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)
- **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is comprehensive, including camera, lighting, and visual shapes. No deductions here.
- **Minor Visualization Issues**: There are no minor issues noted in the visualization setup. No deductions here.

**Score: 5/5**

### Final Score Calculation
- Completeness: 40/40
- Correctness: 30/30
- Code Quality: 10/10
- Efficiency: 10/10
- Error Handling and Robustness: 0/5
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5/5

**Total Score: 40 + 30 + 10 + 10 + 0 + 5 = 95**

### Final Score Output
**Score**: [[95]]

### Explanation of Deductions
- The primary deduction was for the lack of error handling and robustness in the code, which is essential for ensuring that the simulation can handle unexpected situations gracefully. This resulted in a score of 0 in that category. All other categories received full marks as the script was complete, correct, well-structured, efficient, and had a good visualization setup.

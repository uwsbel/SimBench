### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code is mostly complete but has some deviations from the reference script.
   - **Missing Components:**
     - The output directory path is set to "BEAM_FAILED" instead of "BEAM_BUCKLING" as in the reference script. (5 points)
     - The motor type is `ChLinkMotorRotationSpeed` instead of `ChLinkMotorRotationAngle`, which changes the behavior of the motor. (10 points)
     - The number of elements in the IGA beam is set to 30 instead of 32, which may affect the mesh quality. (5 points)
     - The visualization shapes for the truss and constraints have slightly different dimensions and properties compared to the reference. (5 points)
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness:** 25 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API:**
     - The motor's torque function is set instead of the angle function, which is a significant change in behavior. (15 points)
   - **Logical Errors:**
     - The dimensions and properties of the beams and constraints differ from the reference script, which could lead to different simulation results. (10 points)
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness:** 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but there are minor issues with variable naming and consistency in comments.
   - **Deductions:**
     - Some variable names (e.g., `box_truss` vs. `boxtruss`) are inconsistent with the reference script. (5 points)
     - Comments are present but could be more descriptive in some areas. (5 points)
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality:** 10 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not appear to have significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script, but there are some minor optimizations that could be made.
   - **Deductions:**
     - The use of `chrono.ChFrame` instead of `chrono.ChFramed` for visualization shapes is less efficient. (5 points)
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency:** 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks error handling mechanisms that are present in the reference script.
   - **Deductions:**
     - There is no error handling for potential issues in the simulation setup or execution. (5 points)
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness:** 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor issues.
   - **Deductions:**
     - The window title and size differ from the reference script, which may affect user experience. (3 points)
     - The visualization shapes have different properties, which could impact clarity. (2 points)
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools:** 5 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 25 + 25 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 75 points
- Final Score: 100 - 75 = 25 points

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

#### Completeness (40 points total)
1. **System Initialization**: The system is correctly initialized with `chrono.ChSystemNSC()`. **(0 points deducted)**
2. **Body Creation**: Both pendulum bodies and the ground body are created and added to the system. **(0 points deducted)**
3. **Visualization Setup**: The visualization system is initialized and configured properly. **(0 points deducted)**
4. **Essential Components**: All essential components are present, including bodies, joints, and visualization. **(0 points deducted)**
5. **Minor Omissions**: The script does not define contact materials for the bodies, which is generally a good practice for realistic simulations. **(5 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Completeness: 5 points**

#### Correctness (30 points total)
1. **API Usage**: The API is used correctly in most instances. However, the `chrono.ChLinkLockRevolute()` should be initialized with a `ChCoordsysD` object instead of `ChFramed`. This could lead to incorrect joint behavior. **(15 points deducted)**
2. **Logical Errors**: The initialization of the revolute joints is done correctly, but the use of `chrono.ChFramed` instead of `chrono.ChCoordsysD` is a significant error. **(10 points deducted)**
3. **Minor Inaccuracies**: The use of `chrono.VNULL` for the visual shape's frame is acceptable, but it could be clearer to specify the position explicitly. **(5 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Correctness: 30 points**

#### Code Quality (10 points total)
1. **Readability and Structure**: The code is well-structured and easy to read. Variable names are meaningful. **(0 points deducted)**
2. **Comments**: While the code is readable, it lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of each section and the reasoning behind certain choices. **(5 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Code Quality: 5 points**

#### Efficiency (10 points total)
1. **Unnecessary Calculations**: There are no significant inefficiencies or redundant calculations present in the code. **(0 points deducted)**
2. **Optimization Opportunities**: The code could benefit from defining a function for the logging process to avoid repetition, but this is a minor point. **(3 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Efficiency: 3 points**

#### Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)
1. **Basic Error Handling**: There is no error handling in the simulation loop, which could lead to crashes if unexpected conditions arise. **(5 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Error Handling: 5 points**

#### Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)
1. **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the addition of a skybox and camera could be improved for better visual context. **(3 points deducted)**
2. **Minor Visualization Issues**: The lighting is added, but there could be more customization for better visual effects. **(2 points deducted)**

**Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points**

### Final Score Calculation
- **Completeness**: 5 points deducted
- **Correctness**: 30 points deducted
- **Code Quality**: 5 points deducted
- **Efficiency**: 3 points deducted
- **Error Handling**: 5 points deducted
- **Use of Visualization Tools**: 5 points deducted

**Total Deductions: 53 points**

**Final Score**: 100 - 53 = 47

### Final Score Output
[[47]] 

### Brief Explanation of Deductions
The script was well-structured and mostly correct, but it had significant issues with joint initialization and lacked sufficient comments. Minor omissions in contact material definitions and error handling were also noted, along with some inefficiencies in logging and visualization setup.

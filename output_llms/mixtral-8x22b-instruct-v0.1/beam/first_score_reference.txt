### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks the creation of a `ChMesh` object, which is essential for organizing the beam elements and nodes. This is a significant omission, leading to a deduction of **15 points**.
     - The reference code includes the definition of a beam section (`ChBeamSectionEulerAdvanced`), which is not present in the provided code. This is another essential component, leading to an additional deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 30 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The provided code uses `ChSystemNSC()` instead of `ChSystemSMC()`, which may lead to differences in simulation behavior, particularly in how contact and material properties are handled. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The provided code does not apply forces or torques to the nodes, which is a critical part of the simulation as seen in the reference code. This omission leads to a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The provided code is generally readable, but it lacks comments explaining the purpose of various sections, which diminishes its clarity compared to the reference script. This leads to a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The provided code does not have any obvious inefficiencies, but it also does not utilize the more efficient `ChMesh` structure for organizing nodes and elements. This leads to a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, such as checking if the visualization system initializes correctly or if nodes are added successfully. This leads to a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code does not include the advanced visualization features present in the reference code, such as visualizing the bending moments or coordinate systems at nodes. This leads to a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: 5 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 75 points
- Final Score: 100 - 75 = 25 points

### Final Score Output

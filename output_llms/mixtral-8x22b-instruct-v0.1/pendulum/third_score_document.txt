### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

#### 1. Completeness (40 points total)
- **System Initialization**: The system is correctly initialized with `chrono.ChSystemNSC()`. No points deducted.
- **Body Creation**: Both the ground and pendulum bodies are created and added to the system. No points deducted.
- **Visualization Setup**: The visualization system is set up correctly. No points deducted.
- **Essential Components**: All essential components are present, including bodies, joints, and visualization. No points deducted.
- **Minor Omissions**: There are no significant omissions. No points deducted.

**Total Deductions**: 0 points

#### 2. Correctness (30 points total)
- **API Usage**: The use of `chrono.ChLinkLockRevolute()` for the revolute joints is correct. No points deducted.
- **Logical Errors**: The initialization of the pendulum positions and the revolute joints is logically sound. No points deducted.
- **Minor Inaccuracies**: The code correctly sets up the pendulums and their connections. No points deducted.

**Total Deductions**: 0 points

#### 3. Code Quality (10 points total)
- **Readability and Structure**: The code is well-structured and easy to read. Variable names are meaningful. No points deducted.
- **Comments**: The code includes comments that explain the purpose of various sections. However, some comments could be more detailed, particularly around the joint initialization and visualization setup.

**Total Deductions**: 5 points

#### 4. Efficiency (10 points total)
- **Unnecessary Calculations**: There are no unnecessary calculations or redundant code. No points deducted.
- **Optimization Opportunities**: The code is efficient in its current form. No points deducted.

**Total Deductions**: 0 points

#### 5. Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)
- **Basic Error Handling**: There is no error handling implemented in the simulation loop, which could lead to issues if the simulation encounters unexpected states. Deducted for lack of basic error handling.

**Total Deductions**: 5 points

#### 6. Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)
- **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the addition of a skybox and typical lights could be considered basic. The logo path is hardcoded, which may lead to issues if the file is not found. Deducted for minor visualization issues.

**Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
- **Total Points**: 100
- **Deductions**: 0 (Completeness) + 0 (Correctness) + 5 (Code Quality) + 0 (Efficiency) + 5 (Error Handling) + 3 (Visualization) = 13 points
- **Final Score**: 100 - 13 = 87

### Final Score Output
[[87]]

### Explanation of Deductions
- **Code Quality**: 5 points deducted for comments that could be more detailed.
- **Error Handling**: 5 points deducted for lack of basic error handling in the simulation loop.
- **Visualization Tools**: 3 points deducted for minor issues with the visualization setup, including hardcoded paths.

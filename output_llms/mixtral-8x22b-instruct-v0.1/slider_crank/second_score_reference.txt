### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components: system initialization, body creation, joint creation, motor setup, and visualization. However, it lacks the line for setting the Chrono data path, which is present in the reference script. This results in a **5-point deduction** for a minor omission.
   - **Total Deductions: 5 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly initializes the bodies and joints, and the motor function is set appropriately. However, the method used to get the motor angle (`my_motor.GetMotorFunction().Get_y(sim_time)`) is incorrect compared to the reference script, which uses `my_motor.GetMotorAngle()`. This leads to a **15-point deduction** for incorrect API usage.
   - The initialization of the prismatic joint includes a rotation that is not present in the reference script. This is a logical error, leading to a **10-point deduction**.
   - **Total Deductions: 25 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. However, there are minor formatting inconsistencies and some comments that could be improved for clarity. This results in a **5-point deduction** for insufficient comments and documentation.
   - **Total Deductions: 5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code is efficient overall, but there are some redundant calculations, such as repeatedly calculating the crank angle using the motor function instead of directly accessing the motor angle. This results in a **5-point deduction** for unnecessary calculations.
   - **Total Deductions: 5 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks any explicit error handling or checks for common issues, such as ensuring that the simulation runs correctly or handling potential exceptions. This results in a **5-point deduction**.
   - **Total Deductions: 5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but there are minor issues, such as the absence of a call to close the visualization device properly. This results in a **3-point deduction** for inadequate visualization setup.
   - **Total Deductions: 3 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 5 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 48 points
- Final Score: 100 - 48 = 52

### Final Score

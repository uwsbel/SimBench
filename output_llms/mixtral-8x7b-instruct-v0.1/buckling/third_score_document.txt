### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: The script includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. No deductions here.
   - **Configuration Details**: The configuration of bodies and constraints appears to be complete and follows the API guidelines. No deductions here.
   - **Minor Omissions**: There are no significant omissions or deviations from best practices. No deductions here.
   - **Score**: 40/40

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The use of `ChSystemSMC()` is appropriate for the simulation context. No deductions here.
   - **Logical Errors**: The initialization of motors, constraints, and bodies appears to be logically sound. No deductions here.
   - **Minor Inaccuracies**: There are no significant inaccuracies or unnecessary API calls. No deductions here.
   - **Score**: 30/30

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. No deductions here.
   - **Comments**: While the code is mostly self-explanatory, it could benefit from more comments explaining the purpose of certain sections, especially for complex parts like the constraints and motor functions. Deduct 5 points for insufficient comments.
   - **Score**: 5/10

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: There are no evident unnecessary calculations or redundant code. No deductions here.
   - **Optimization Opportunities**: The code could potentially optimize the way visual shapes are added or how the mesh is built, but these are not critical issues. Deduct 3 points for missing minor optimization opportunities.
   - **Score**: 7/10

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Basic Error Handling**: The script lacks any form of error handling, such as checking if the bodies or constraints were successfully created or initialized. Deduct 5 points for this lack of basic error handling.
   - **Score**: 0/5

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is comprehensive and utilizes the Irrlicht engine effectively. No deductions here.
   - **Minor Visualization Issues**: The lighting and camera setup could be improved for better visibility, but this is a minor issue. Deduct 2 points for suboptimal lighting.
   - **Score**: 3/5

### Final Score Calculation
- Completeness: 40/40
- Correctness: 30/30
- Code Quality: 5/10
- Efficiency: 7/10
- Error Handling: 0/5
- Visualization: 3/5

**Total Score**: 40 + 30 + 5 + 7 + 0 + 3 = 85

### Final Score Output
[[85]]

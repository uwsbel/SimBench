### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks several essential components that are present in the reference script. Specifically:
     - **System Initialization**: The reference script initializes the Chrono system (`chrono.ChSystemNSC()`), which is missing in the provided code. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - **Vehicle Creation and Initialization**: The reference script creates and initializes a vehicle object, which is not present in the provided code. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - **Terrain Creation**: The reference script includes terrain setup, which is also missing. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - Total deductions for completeness: **45 points** (but capped at 40 points).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code does not contain any incorrect uses of the PyChrono API that would significantly change simulation behavior, as it is primarily focused on adding lights. However, the absence of vehicle and terrain initialization could lead to logical errors in the overall simulation context. **(Deduct 10 points for logical errors due to missing components)**.
   - Total deductions for correctness: **10 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The provided code is relatively straightforward and readable, but it lacks comments explaining the purpose of the light setup. The reference script includes more detailed comments and structure. **(Deduct 5 points for insufficient comments)**.
   - Total deductions for code quality: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. However, it does not leverage any optimizations that could be inferred from the reference script, such as setting up the visualization system or initializing the vehicle and terrain efficiently. **(Deduct 3 points for missing obvious optimization opportunities)**.
   - Total deductions for efficiency: **3 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the successful creation of the sensor manager or lights. The reference script handles various aspects more robustly. **(Deduct 5 points for lack of basic error handling)**.
   - Total deductions for error handling: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The provided code sets up point lights but does not include other visualization elements such as a camera or skybox, which are present in the reference script. **(Deduct 3 points for inadequate visualization setup)**.
   - Total deductions for visualization tools: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points
- Correctness: 10 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total deductions: 40 + 10 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 3 = 66 points
- Final Score: 100 - 66 = 34 points

### Final Score Output

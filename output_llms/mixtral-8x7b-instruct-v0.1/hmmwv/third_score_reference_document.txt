### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script, such as system initialization, vehicle creation, and visualization setup. However, it lacks a clear comment section that describes the purpose of each block of code, which is present in the reference script.
   - **Deductions**: 
     - Minor omissions or slight deviations: **5 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The script uses the PyChrono API correctly in most parts. However, there is a logical error in the `while` loop where the condition `vehicle.GetSystem().GetChTime() < 4` is checked after `vis.Run()`. This could lead to an infinite loop if the visualization does not terminate correctly.
   - **Deductions**:
     - Logical errors: **10 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of various sections and parameters, which would enhance understanding for future users or developers.
   - **Deductions**:
     - Insufficient comments: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code is efficient and does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. However, the use of `vis.GetDevice().sleep(int(1000 * step_size))` could be optimized by using a more efficient timing mechanism.
   - **Deductions**:
     - Missing obvious optimization opportunities: **3 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The script does not include any error handling mechanisms, such as checks for successful initialization of the vehicle or visualization system, which could lead to crashes if something goes wrong.
   - **Deductions**:
     - Lack of basic error handling: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the script does not include the `AddTypicalLights()` function, which is present in the reference script and enhances the visual quality of the simulation.
   - **Deductions**:
     - Incorrect or inadequate visualization setup: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 10 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total deductions: 31 points
- Final score: 100 - 31 = 69

### Final Score

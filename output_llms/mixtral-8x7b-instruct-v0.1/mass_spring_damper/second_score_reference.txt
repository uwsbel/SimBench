### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. However, there are some minor deviations:
     - The `MySpringForce` class in the provided code does not correctly implement the `evaluate` method as in the reference script. Instead, it uses `AddForce`, which is not the expected method for the force functor in this context. This is a significant deviation, leading to a deduction of **10 points**.
     - The `spring_2` initialization uses `chrono.ChLinkSpring()` instead of `chrono.ChLinkTSDA()`, which is inconsistent with the reference script. This is a significant omission, leading to a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness: 25 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The use of `AddForce` in `MySpringForce` is incorrect as it does not align with the expected API usage for force functors. This leads to a deduction of **15 points**.
   - The `spring_2` is initialized incorrectly with `chrono.ChLinkSpring()` instead of `chrono.ChLinkTSDA()`, which is a significant logical error, leading to another deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness: 30 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is relatively well-structured and readable, but it lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of certain sections, particularly around the force functor and spring initialization. This leads to a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality: 5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit any unnecessary calculations or redundant code compared to the reference script. However, the incorrect use of `AddForce` could lead to inefficiencies in the simulation. There are no clear optimization opportunities that are missed.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency: 0 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which is a significant oversight. The reference script does not explicitly handle errors either, but it is more robust in its structure. This leads to a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup in the provided code is mostly correct and matches the reference script. However, the `AddVisualShape` method for the springs is not consistent with the reference script, which uses `RegisterForceFunctor`. This leads to a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 30 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 25 + 30 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 3 = 68 points
- Final Score: 100 - 68 = 32 points

### Final Score Output

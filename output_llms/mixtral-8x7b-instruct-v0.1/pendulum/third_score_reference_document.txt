### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code is mostly complete but has some minor omissions:
     - The second pendulum's visualization cylinder is incorrectly named `cyl_1` instead of `cyl_2`, which is a minor deviation. **(Deduct 5 points)**
     - The initial position of the second pendulum is set to `(2, 0, 1)` instead of `(3, 0, 1)` as in the reference. **(Deduct 5 points)**
     - The initialization of the second revolute joint is incorrect; it should connect the second pendulum to the first at `(2, 0, 1)` instead of `(0, 0, 1)`. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - Total deductions: **20 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The use of the PyChrono API is mostly correct, but there are significant logical errors:
     - The initialization of the second revolute joint is incorrect, which could lead to a significant change in simulation behavior. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - The time step in the simulation loop is set to `1e-3`, while the reference uses `1e-2`, which is a logical inconsistency. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - Total deductions: **25 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally readable and well-structured, but the comments could be improved for clarity:
     - Some comments are present but lack detail compared to the reference script. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - Total deductions: **5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. However, the time step discrepancy could affect performance:
     - The time step used in the simulation loop is smaller than necessary, which could lead to unnecessary calculations. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - Total deductions: **5 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - There is no explicit error handling present in the provided code, which is a concern:
     - The reference script does not have robust error handling either, but it is better to include basic checks. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - Total deductions: **5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the naming inconsistency for the second pendulum's visualization shape could lead to confusion:
     - The use of `cyl_1` for both pendulums is misleading. **(Deduct 3 points)**
   - Total deductions: **3 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 20 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total deductions: 63 points
- Final score: 100 - 63 = 37 points

### Final Score Output

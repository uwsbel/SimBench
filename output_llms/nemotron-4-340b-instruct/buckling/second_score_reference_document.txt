### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided script lacks several components that are present in the reference script. Notably, it does not include the building of the IGA beam, the creation of constraints between beams, and the detailed visualization setup for the FEM mesh. Each of these omissions is significant.
     - **Deductions**: 15 points for missing IGA beam setup, 15 points for missing constraints, and 15 points for missing detailed visualization setup = **45 points** (exceeds 40, capped at 40).
   - **Total Deductions**: 40 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The script has multiple instances of incorrect API usage, particularly in the definition of beam sections and the lack of proper initialization for certain elements. For example, the `SetShearModulusFromPoisson` method is called multiple times unnecessarily.
     - **Deductions**: 15 points for incorrect API usage and 10 points for logical errors in beam section definitions = **25 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is somewhat readable, but the excessive repetition of `SetShearModulusFromPoisson` detracts from clarity. Additionally, the comments are not as detailed as in the reference script.
     - **Deductions**: 5 points for readability and structure, 5 points for insufficient comments = **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 10 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Redundant Code**: The multiple calls to `SetShearModulusFromPoisson` are redundant and could be optimized. There are also opportunities for better structuring of the beam section properties.
     - **Deductions**: 5 points for unnecessary calculations and 3 points for missing optimization opportunities = **8 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 8 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The script does not include any error handling mechanisms or checks for the successful creation of bodies or constraints, which are present in the reference script.
     - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of basic error handling.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is incomplete compared to the reference script, lacking the detailed configuration of visual elements and lighting.
     - **Deductions**: 5 points for inadequate visualization setup.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 8 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a maximum score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 40 + 25 + 10 + 8 + 5 + 5 = 93 points
- Final Score: 100 - 93 = 7 points

### Final Score Output

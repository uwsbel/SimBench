### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code is missing the creation of a visual shape for the hinge constraint (a sphere) that is present in the reference script. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - The provided code does not include the second beam creation that connects to the box, which is present in the reference. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - The provided code lacks the initialization of the second set of constraints (constraint_pos2 and constraint_dir2) for the second beam. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - The provided code does not print the time in the `PrintBodyPositions` method, which is included in the reference. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - Total deductions: **50 points** (over the maximum of 40 points, capped at 40).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The provided code uses `SetForce` on the front node of the beam, while the reference applies the force to the back node. This could lead to a significant difference in simulation behavior. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - The provided code initializes the box's position based on the last beam node's position, but the reference code offsets it by an additional vector. This could lead to incorrect positioning. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - Total deductions: **25 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The provided code has a reasonable structure and variable naming, but it lacks comments explaining the purpose of certain sections, especially around the constraints and body creation. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - Total deductions: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code has some redundant calculations, such as repeatedly calling `builder.GetLastBeamNodes().back()` when it could store the result in a variable. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - Total deductions: **5 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the success of operations, which could lead to issues during execution. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - Total deductions: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include the visualization for the hinge constraint, which is present in the reference. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - Total deductions: **5 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: **40 points**
- Correctness: **25 points**
- Code Quality: **5 points**
- Efficiency: **5 points**
- Error Handling and Robustness: **5 points**
- Use of Visualization Tools: **5 points**

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a full score of 100 points:
- Total deductions: 40 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = **85 points**
- Final score: **100 - 85 = 15 points**

### Final Score Output

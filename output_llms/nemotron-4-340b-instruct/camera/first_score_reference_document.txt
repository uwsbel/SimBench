### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **System Initialization**: The provided code uses `chrono.ChSystemSMC()` instead of `chrono.ChSystemNSC()`, which is a significant deviation as it changes the contact model. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Body Creation**: The body is created, but it lacks a visual representation and proper attachment of the visual shape, which is present in the reference. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Camera Setup**: The camera sensor is added, but it lacks the detailed configuration and filtering that the reference script provides. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Simulation Loop**: The loop is present, but it lacks proper time management and does not utilize the sensor manager effectively. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 + 10 + 10 + 5 = **40 points**.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The use of `chrono.ChSystemSMC()` instead of `chrono.ChSystemNSC()` is a significant error that could lead to different simulation behavior. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: The camera's position and rotation settings are not correctly implemented as per the reference. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Minor Inaccuracies**: The noise model and visualization type settings are not aligned with the reference. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 15 + 10 + 5 = **30 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The code is generally readable, but it lacks meaningful comments and clear structure compared to the reference. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Insufficient Comments**: The code lacks detailed comments explaining the purpose of various sections, which are present in the reference. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 + 5 = **10 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The code includes redundant calculations for the camera's position that could be optimized. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Missing Optimizations**: The reference script uses a more efficient approach to manage the camera and sensor updates. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 + 3 = **8 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are present in the reference. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is incomplete compared to the reference, which includes additional lighting and visual elements. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: **5 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points
- Correctness: 30 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 8 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 40 + 30 + 10 + 8 + 5 + 5 = **98 points**.

Final Score: **100 - 98 = 2**.

### Final Score Output

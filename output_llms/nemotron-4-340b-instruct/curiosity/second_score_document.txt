### Evaluation of the PyChrono Simulation Script

#### Completeness (40 points total)
- **System Initialization**: The system is correctly initialized using `chrono.ChSystemNSC()`. No points deducted.
- **Body Creation**: The ground and obstacle bodies are created properly, and the rover is initialized correctly. No points deducted.
- **Visualization Setup**: The visualization system is set up correctly with appropriate camera and lighting. No points deducted.
- **Simulation Loop**: The simulation loop is present and structured correctly. No points deducted.
- **Missing Components**: There are no missing essential components. No points deducted.

**Total Deductions**: 0 points

#### Correctness (30 points total)
- **API Usage**: The API is used correctly throughout the script. No significant errors that would change simulation behavior were found.
- **Logical Errors**: The rover's initialization and driver setup are correct. No points deducted.
- **Minor Inaccuracies**: The use of `driver.SetSteering(0)` is appropriate for moving forward, but it could be more explicit about the intended behavior (e.g., setting speed). Deducted 5 points for this minor inaccuracy.

**Total Deductions**: 5 points

#### Code Quality (10 points total)
- **Readability and Structure**: The code is well-structured and readable. Variable names are meaningful. No points deducted.
- **Comments**: While there are some comments, they could be more detailed to explain the purpose of certain sections (e.g., the simulation loop). Deducted 5 points for insufficient comments.

**Total Deductions**: 5 points

#### Efficiency (10 points total)
- **Unnecessary Calculations**: The code does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. No points deducted.
- **Optimization Opportunities**: The simulation loop could be optimized by checking for conditions to break out of the loop earlier if needed, but this is not critical. Deducted 3 points for missing this optimization opportunity.

**Total Deductions**: 3 points

#### Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)
- **Basic Error Handling**: There is no error handling present in the code, which could lead to issues if the simulation encounters unexpected states. Deducted 5 points for lack of basic error handling.

**Total Deductions**: 5 points

#### Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)
- **Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is mostly correct, but shadows are commented out for performance without justification. Deducted 3 points for this minor visualization issue.
- **Minor Issues**: The lighting setup is adequate, but could be improved for better visual quality. Deducted 2 points for minor visualization issues.

**Total Deductions**: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
- **Total Points Deducted**: 5 (Correctness) + 5 (Code Quality) + 3 (Efficiency) + 5 (Error Handling) + 5 (Visualization) = 23 points
- **Final Score**: 40 - 23 = 17

### Final Score Output
[[17]]

### Summary of Deductions
- **Correctness**: Minor inaccuracy in the driver's steering input (5 points).
- **Code Quality**: Insufficient comments (5 points).
- **Efficiency**: Missed optimization opportunity in the simulation loop (3 points).
- **Error Handling**: Lack of basic error handling (5 points).
- **Use of Visualization Tools**: Minor issues with shadow settings and visualization quality (5 points).

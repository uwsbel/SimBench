### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components (15 points each)**: 
     - The provided code lacks several components present in the reference script, such as setting up a terrain, vehicle initialization, and proper visualization setup (e.g., camera, lights). 
     - **Deductions**: 15 points for missing terrain setup, 15 points for missing vehicle initialization, and 15 points for missing camera and lighting setup.
     - Total: **45 points deducted**.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 45 points (over the maximum of 40, capped at 40).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API (15 points each)**: 
     - The code initializes a new `ChSystemSMC()` multiple times instead of storing it in a variable and using that instance throughout. This can lead to confusion and errors in simulation behavior.
     - **Deductions**: 15 points for incorrect system initialization.
   - **Logical Errors (10 points each)**: 
     - The pendulum body is created and added to a new system instance instead of the initialized one, which could lead to runtime errors.
     - **Deductions**: 10 points for logical error in body addition.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure (5 to 10 points)**: 
     - The code lacks meaningful variable names and comments explaining the purpose of each section, making it less readable compared to the reference script.
     - **Deductions**: 5 points for poor readability.
   - **Insufficient Comments (5 points)**: 
     - The code has minimal comments, which do not adequately explain the logic or purpose of the code sections.
     - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: 10 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations (5 points each)**: 
     - The code redundantly initializes the system multiple times, which is inefficient.
     - **Deductions**: 5 points for unnecessary calculations.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: 5 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Basic Error Handling (5 points)**: 
     - The code does not include any error handling mechanisms or checks for successful initialization of components, which could lead to runtime issues.
     - **Deductions**: 5 points.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup (3 to 5 points)**: 
     - The visualization setup is minimal and does not include essential elements like camera positioning, lighting, or scene rendering, which are present in the reference script.
     - **Deductions**: 5 points for inadequate visualization setup.
   - **Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools**: 5 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 40 + 25 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 90 points
- Final Score: 100 - 90 = 10

### Final Score Output
[[10]]

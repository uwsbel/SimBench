### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks the use of `ChBuilderBeamIGA`, which is essential for creating the beam mesh properly as seen in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
     - The reference script includes a truss and an end bearing, which are not present in the provided code. This results in another deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The provided code initializes `chrono.ChSystemSMC()` multiple times instead of storing it in a variable and using that variable throughout the code. This could lead to confusion and potential errors in larger scripts. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The motor is initialized incorrectly as it does not connect to a fixed body (the truss) as in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The code lacks meaningful comments and variable names that explain the purpose of various components. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The repeated initialization of `chrono.ChSystemSMC()` is inefficient. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling or checks for the successful initialization of components. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code does not include the same level of detail in visualization as the reference script, such as adding visual shapes for the beam. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 73 points
- Final Score: 100 - 73 = 27 points

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script, such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. There are no missing essential components.
   - **Score Deduction**: 0 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code uses the PyChrono API correctly in most instances. However, there are a few minor inaccuracies:
     - The constant `CH_PI` is defined as `3.1456`, which is not accurate; it should be `3.1416` (or `math.pi`).
     - The flywheel's initial position has a hardcoded Y offset of `0.05`, which may not be necessary depending on the context.
   - **Score Deduction**: 10 points (5 points for the incorrect value of `CH_PI` and 5 points for the hardcoded offset)

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names and appropriate comments. However, some comments could be more descriptive, especially regarding the purpose of certain parameters in function calls.
   - **Score Deduction**: 5 points for insufficient comments on some function parameters.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit any unnecessary calculations or redundant code. It follows the reference script closely in terms of efficiency.
   - **Score Deduction**: 0 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any explicit error handling or checks for potential issues, such as verifying that the nodes exist before accessing them.
   - **Score Deduction**: 5 points for lack of basic error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is similar to the reference script, with appropriate use of visualization tools. However, there could be minor improvements in the lighting setup or camera positioning.
   - **Score Deduction**: 2 points for minor visualization issues.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points
- Correctness: 10 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a total of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 10 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 2 = 22 points
- Final Score: 100 - 22 = 78

**Final Score**: [[78]]

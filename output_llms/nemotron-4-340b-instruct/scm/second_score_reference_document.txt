### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code is mostly complete but lacks the use of a method to set parameters for the terrain in a structured way, as seen in the reference script. Instead of using a dedicated method to set parameters, the script initializes parameters directly in the constructor, which is less flexible. 
   - **Deductions**: 10 points for the lack of a structured parameter setting method.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The script uses the `SCMParameters` class correctly but does not utilize the `SetParameters` method to apply the parameters to the terrain, which is a significant deviation from the reference script. This could lead to issues in parameter application.
   - **Deductions**: 15 points for incorrect use of the API that could lead to significant simulation behavior changes.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally readable and well-structured, but it lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of certain blocks of code, especially around the parameter initialization and terrain setup.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not exhibit significant inefficiencies, but it could be optimized by using the structured parameter setting method from the reference script. However, there are no glaring inefficiencies present.
   - **Deductions**: 3 points for missing an optimization opportunity.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling for the initialization of the vehicle or terrain, which could lead to runtime errors if the parameters are incorrect or if the vehicle fails to initialize properly.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for lack of basic error handling.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but it does not include the `AddTypicalLights()` method, which is present in the reference script and enhances the visual quality of the simulation.
   - **Deductions**: 3 points for inadequate visualization setup.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 10 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total deductions: 41 points
- Final score: 100 - 41 = 59

### Final Score

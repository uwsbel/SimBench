### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components present in the reference script. There are no missing components, and all necessary initializations and configurations are present.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code uses the PyChrono API correctly, and there are no significant changes in simulation behavior compared to the reference. All properties and methods match the reference script.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable names. However, there are some minor comments that could be improved for clarity. The reference script has slightly better documentation in some areas.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted.**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code is efficient and does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. There are no obvious optimization opportunities missed compared to the reference script.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code lacks explicit error handling mechanisms. The reference script does not showcase any advanced error handling either, but it is generally good practice to include some basic checks.
   - **Score: 5 points deducted.**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup in the provided code is adequate and closely follows the reference script. There are no significant issues with lighting or visual elements.
   - **Score: 0 points deducted.**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 0 points
- Correctness: 0 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 0 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 0 points

### Final Score Calculation
Total deductions: 5 (Code Quality) + 5 (Error Handling) = 10 points deducted from a total of 100 points.

Final Score: 100 - 10 = **90**

### Final Score Output
[[90]]

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks a proper system initialization (`ChSystemSMC`), which is crucial for running simulations in PyChrono. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
     - The reference script includes a detailed setup for the physical system, including body creation and constraints, which are not adequately represented in the provided code. This results in an additional deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect API Usage**: 
     - The use of `ChLinkCreateStatic` and `ChLinkCreatePrismatic` is incorrect for the intended simulation. The reference script uses `ChLinkMotorRotationAngle` for motor functionality, which is more appropriate. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The provided code does not correctly set up the beam and its constraints, leading to potential simulation errors. This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The provided code lacks meaningful variable names and comments compared to the reference script, which is well-structured and documented. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Comments**: 
     - The provided code has minimal comments, making it harder to understand the purpose of certain sections. This results in an additional deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 10 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The provided code includes redundant calculations and inefficient API calls, such as the way the solver and timestepper are set up. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The provided code does not set up the visualization as comprehensively as the reference script, which includes various visual elements and settings. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
The total deductions amount to **80 points** from a maximum of **100 points**, resulting in a final score of **20 points**.

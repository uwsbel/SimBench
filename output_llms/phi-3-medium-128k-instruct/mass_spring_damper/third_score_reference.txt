### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code is missing the creation of `body_2` and `body_3` at the correct positions as per the reference script. The reference script has `body_2` positioned at `(-1, -6, 0)` and `body_3` at `(-1, -9, 0)`, while the provided code has them at `(0, -3, 0)` and `(1, -3, 0)`, respectively. This results in a deduction of **15 points** for each body, totaling **30 points**.
   - The visualization assets for `body_2` and `body_3` are not included in the provided code, which is another essential component. This results in an additional deduction of **15 points**.
   - Total deductions for completeness: **45 points** (exceeds the maximum, capped at 40).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The initialization of springs is incorrect. The reference script connects `body_2` to `body_1` and `body_3` to `body_2`, while the provided code connects `body_1` to `body_2` and `body_2` to `body_3`. This is a significant logical error, resulting in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - The properties of the bodies (mass and inertia) are set correctly in both scripts, so no deductions here.
   - Total deductions for correctness: **15 points**.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks sufficient comments compared to the reference script. The reference script has more detailed comments explaining each section. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - Total deductions for code quality: **5 points**.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code does not exhibit any significant inefficiencies compared to the reference script. Both scripts use similar structures and API calls. Therefore, no deductions are necessary.
   - Total deductions for efficiency: **0 points**.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling or robustness checks, which are not explicitly present in the reference script either. However, the reference script is more robust in its setup. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - Total deductions for error handling and robustness: **5 points**.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup in the provided code is similar to the reference script, but it lacks the additional visual assets for `body_2` and `body_3`. This results in a deduction of **3 points** for inadequate visualization setup.
   - Total deductions for visualization tools: **3 points**.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: **40 points** (capped)
- Correctness: **15 points**
- Code Quality: **5 points**
- Efficiency: **0 points**
- Error Handling and Robustness: **5 points**
- Use of Visualization Tools: **3 points**

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total deductions: 40 + 15 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 3 = 68 points
- Final score: 100 - 68 = 32

### Final Score Output
[[32]]

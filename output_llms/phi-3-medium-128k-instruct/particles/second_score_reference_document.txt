### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. However, there is a minor omission in the energy calculations where the `EmptyAccumulators()` method is missing before calculating kinetic energy. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Points Deducted: 5**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The gravitational constant `G_constant` is defined after its first use in the energy calculations, which can lead to a runtime error. This is a significant logical error, resulting in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - The calculation of kinetic energy uses `body.GetPosDt()` instead of `body.GetLinearVelocity()`, which is incorrect. This is another significant error, resulting in an additional deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Points Deducted: 30**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable. However, there are some minor issues with formatting and lack of comments explaining the purpose of certain sections, especially in the simulation loop. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Points Deducted: 5**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code contains redundant calculations in the energy calculation section. Specifically, the potential energy is calculated twice in two separate loops, which is inefficient. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Points Deducted: 5**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The code lacks basic error handling for potential issues such as division by zero in the gravitational force calculations. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Points Deducted: 5**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct and follows the reference script closely. However, there is a minor issue with the lighting setup that could be improved. This results in a deduction of **2 points**.
   - **Points Deducted: 2**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 30 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
The total deductions amount to **52 points** from a possible **100 points**. Therefore, the final score is:

**Final Score: 100 - 52 = 48**

### Final Score Output

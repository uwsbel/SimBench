### Evaluation of the Simulation Script

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code is missing the initialization of the three sphere bodies in a more structured manner as seen in the reference script. The reference script creates all three spheres at the beginning, while the provided script creates one sphere initially and adds two more later in the simulation. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Minor Omissions**: The reference script has a clearer structure for body creation and initial velocities, while the provided script lacks this clarity. This results in an additional deduction of **5 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Completeness: 20 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The provided script uses `msphereBody` for the first sphere and later adds `msphereBody2` and `msphereBody3` without a clear distinction in their roles. The reference script initializes all three spheres distinctly and sets their initial velocities in a more organized manner. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: The gravitational constant is modified in the provided script, which could lead to confusion regarding its intended use. The reference script does not modify this constant, leading to a deduction of **10 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Correctness: 25 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided script is somewhat less organized than the reference script, particularly in the way bodies are created and initialized. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Comments**: The provided script lacks sufficient comments compared to the reference script, which provides better documentation. This results in an additional deduction of **5 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Code Quality: 10 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The provided script calculates forces and energies in a less efficient manner by iterating through combinations of bodies multiple times. The reference script handles this more efficiently. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Missing Optimization Opportunities**: The provided script could benefit from better organization of the energy calculations, similar to the reference script. This results in an additional deduction of **3 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Efficiency: 8 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided script does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are essential for robustness. The reference script does not explicitly show error handling but is structured to avoid common pitfalls. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The provided script has a similar visualization setup to the reference script, but it lacks the clarity in the title and description of the simulation. This results in a deduction of **3 points**.
   - **Minor Visualization Issues**: The provided script does not include a skybox or other visual enhancements as clearly as the reference script. This results in an additional deduction of **2 points**.

   **Total Deductions for Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 20 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 8 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 73 points
- Final Score: 100 - 73 = 27 points

### Final Score

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **System Initialization**: The provided code initializes the PyChrono environment but does not create a simulation system (like `ChSystemNSC()` in the reference). **Deduct 15 points**.
   - **Body Creation**: The reference script uses specific body types (e.g., `ChBodyEasyBox`, `ChBodyEasyCylinder`) with defined properties, while the provided code uses generic shapes without density or mass properties. **Deduct 15 points**.
   - **Visualization**: The provided code uses `irr` for visualization but lacks several elements present in the reference, such as adding a skybox, typical lights, and a proper camera setup. **Deduct 10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 40 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **API Usage**: The provided code uses `pc` which seems to be a non-standard or incorrect import compared to the reference's `chrono`. This could lead to significant differences in behavior. **Deduct 15 points**.
   - **Joint Initialization**: The joints in the provided code are initialized incorrectly (e.g., using `RevoluteJoint` instead of the more appropriate `ChLinkLockRevolute`). **Deduct 10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code lacks meaningful variable names and proper structure compared to the reference. **Deduct 5 points**.
   - **Comments**: The provided code has minimal comments, making it less understandable. **Deduct 5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: 10 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Redundant Code**: The provided code has unnecessary object creation and lacks optimization seen in the reference. **Deduct 5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: 5 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Basic Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling or robustness checks that are present in the reference. **Deduct 5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The provided code has an inadequate setup for visualization compared to the reference, lacking elements like a logo, skybox, and proper lighting. **Deduct 5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: 5 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 40 + 25 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 90 points
- Final Score: 100 - 90 = 10 points

### Final Score Output

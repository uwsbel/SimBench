### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks several essential components present in the reference script:
     - The reference script includes a constraint between the horizontal and vertical beams, which is missing in the provided code. **(15 points deduction)**
     - The reference script also includes a constraint between the crank beam and the body crank, which is not present in the provided code. **(15 points deduction)**
     - The provided code does not include the creation of a vertical beam or its associated properties, which is a significant omission. **(15 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Completeness**: 45 points (exceeds maximum, capped at 40 points).

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The provided code uses `ChLinkMotorRotationSpeed` instead of `ChLinkMotorRotationAngle`, which could lead to a significant change in simulation behavior. **(15 points deduction)**
   - **Logical Errors**: The initialization of the crank body position is incorrect; it should be based on `vB` instead of `vC`. **(10 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Correctness**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code is poorly structured, with many lines of code that are either incomplete or nonsensical (e.g., the long string of commas and underscores). This severely impacts readability. **(10 points deduction)**
   - **Comments**: While there are some comments, they are not sufficient to explain the code effectively, especially in the context of the missing components. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Code Quality**: 15 points (capped at 10 points).

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The provided code does not appear to have significant optimizations compared to the reference script, but it also does not include unnecessary calculations. However, the lack of constraints and proper structure leads to inefficiencies. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Efficiency**: 5 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Basic Error Handling**: The provided code lacks any error handling or robustness checks that are present in the reference script. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Error Handling**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Visualization Setup**: The provided code lacks a complete visualization setup, including the addition of visual shapes for constraints and the proper initialization of the visualization system. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions for Visualization Tools**: 5 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 40 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling: 5 points
- Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from 100 points:
- Deductions: 40 + 25 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 90 points
- Final Score: 100 - 90 = 10 points

### Final Score Output
[[10]]

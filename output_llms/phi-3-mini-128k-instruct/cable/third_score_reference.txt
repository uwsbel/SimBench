### Evaluation of the Provided Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks several components that are present in the reference script:
     - The reference script initializes a solver and sets its parameters, which is missing in the provided code. **(Deduct 15 points)**
     - The reference script includes a simulation loop that advances the simulation, which is also absent in the provided code. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The provided code uses `chrono.ChBox()` instead of `chrono.ChBodyEasyBox()`, which could lead to differences in body properties and behavior. **(Deduct 15 points)**
   - **Logical Errors**: The provided code initializes constraints and visual shapes in a way that does not align with the reference script's logic, particularly in how bodies are connected and visualized. **(Deduct 10 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code is relatively well-structured but lacks some clarity in variable naming and organization compared to the reference script. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Comments**: The provided code has comments but they are not as detailed or informative as those in the reference script. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 10 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Redundant Code**: The provided code has some redundancy in visualization setup that could be optimized, such as adding visual shapes for the same elements multiple times. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Missing Optimization**: The reference script uses a more efficient way to create and connect bodies and constraints. **(Deduct 3 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 8 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling or checks that are present in the reference script. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The provided code does not set up the visualization tools as comprehensively as the reference script, particularly in terms of lighting and camera setup. **(Deduct 5 points)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 8 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a perfect score of 100:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 25 + 10 + 8 + 5 + 5 = 83 points
- Final Score: 100 - 83 = 17

### Final Score Output

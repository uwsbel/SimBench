### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Essential Components**: 
     - The provided code lacks the simulation loop that is present in the reference script. This is a critical component for running the simulation continuously. **(15 points deduction)**
     - The sedan vehicle is initialized using `veh.Kraz()` instead of `veh.BMW_E90()`, which is a specific vehicle model in the reference. This is a significant deviation. **(15 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 30 points

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: 
     - The code does not set the tire model for the sedan vehicle, which is done in the reference script. This could lead to incorrect simulation behavior. **(15 points deduction)**
   - **Logical Errors**: 
     - The truck and sedan vehicles are initialized without a proper terrain setup in the simulation loop, which is crucial for vehicle dynamics. **(10 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: 
     - The code is somewhat structured but lacks comments explaining the purpose of various sections, which diminishes readability. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: 
     - The code contains redundant calls to set visualization types for both vehicles, which could be optimized. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: 
     - The code does not include any error handling mechanisms or checks for the initialization of vehicles and terrain, which could lead to runtime errors. **(5 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: 
     - The visualization setup is incomplete compared to the reference, particularly in terms of the camera and lighting configuration. **(3 points deduction)**
   - **Total Deductions**: 3 points

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 30 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 3 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from a total of 100 points:
- Total Deductions: 30 + 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 73 points
- Final Score: 100 - 73 = 27 points

### Final Score Output

### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. However, there are minor deviations in the naming of the sphere bodies (e.g., `msphereBody`, `msphere2Body`, `msphere3Body` vs. `sphere1`, `sphere2`, `sphere3` in the reference). This results in a deduction of **5 points** for minor naming inconsistencies.
   - **Total Deductions: 5 points**

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The code correctly uses the PyChrono API for most parts. However, there is an incorrect method used for setting initial velocities: `SetVel` is used instead of `SetPosDt` for setting the initial velocities of the spheres. This is a significant error as it affects the simulation behavior. Therefore, a deduction of **15 points** is warranted.
   - **Total Deductions: 15 points**

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable, but it lacks sufficient comments explaining the purpose of various sections and parameters. The reference code provides better documentation. Thus, a deduction of **5 points** is appropriate for insufficient comments.
   - **Total Deductions: 5 points**

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The provided code performs unnecessary calculations, particularly in the energy calculations where it calculates forces for every pair of bodies in the system. The reference code does not show any redundant calculations, which suggests that the provided code could be optimized. A deduction of **5 points** is appropriate for this inefficiency.
   - **Total Deductions: 5 points**

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which could lead to issues during execution. The reference code does not explicitly show error handling either, but it is generally a good practice to include checks. A deduction of **5 points** is warranted for the lack of basic error handling.
   - **Total Deductions: 5 points**

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the window title in the provided code is different from the reference. This is a minor issue, leading to a deduction of **2 points** for this inconsistency.
   - **Total Deductions: 2 points**

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 5 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
The total deductions amount to **37 points** from a maximum of **100 points**. Therefore, the final score is:

\[ \text{Final Score} = 100 - 37 = 63 \]

### Final Score Output

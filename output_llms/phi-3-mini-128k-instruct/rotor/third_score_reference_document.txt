### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - **Missing Components**: The provided code lacks the initialization of the visualization system (`vis = chronoirr.ChVisualSystemIrrlicht()` and related setup), which is present in the reference script. This results in a deduction of **15 points**.
   - **Incorrect Configuration**: The `mvisualizebeamC` setup is incomplete and lacks important details compared to the reference script (e.g., missing `SetSymbolsThickness`, `SetSymbolsScale`, and `SetZbufferHide`). This results in a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - **Incorrect Use of API**: The `CH_PI` constant is defined as `3.141592653589793`, while the reference uses `3.1456`, which is incorrect. This could lead to significant changes in simulation behavior. Deduct **15 points**.
   - **Logical Errors**: The custom motor function class `ChFunctionMyFun` is incorrectly implemented compared to the reference. The logic for the motor function is not equivalent to the reference, leading to a deduction of **10 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 25 points.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - **Readability and Structure**: The provided code lacks proper formatting and has unnecessary comments that do not add value. This results in a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Insufficient Comments**: While there are some comments, they do not adequately explain the purpose of various sections of the code compared to the reference. Deduct **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 10 points.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - **Unnecessary Calculations**: The code performs some redundant calculations, such as the repeated calculation of inertia properties that could be simplified. Deduct **5 points**.
   - **Missing Optimization**: The reference script uses a more efficient way to define the motor function. Deduct **3 points** for not implementing similar optimizations.
   - **Total Deductions**: 8 points.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - **Lack of Error Handling**: The provided code does not include any error handling mechanisms, which are crucial for robustness. Deduct **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - **Inadequate Visualization Setup**: The visualization setup is incomplete and does not match the reference script, leading to a deduction of **5 points**.
   - **Total Deductions**: 5 points.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 25 points
- Correctness: 25 points
- Code Quality: 10 points
- Efficiency: 8 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 5 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 5 points

### Final Score Calculation
The total deductions amount to **78 points** from a maximum of **100 points**.

**Final Score**: 100 - 78 = **22**

### Final Score Output

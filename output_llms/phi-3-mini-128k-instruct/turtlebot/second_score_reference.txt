### Evaluation of the Provided PyChrono Code

1. **Completeness (40 points total)**
   - The provided code includes all essential components such as system initialization, body creation, and visualization setup. However, there are minor deviations:
     - The robot's motor speed settings in the `move` function differ from the reference script, which could be considered a slight deviation in completeness. 
     - The print statements in the simulation loop are slightly different in wording but convey the same information.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for minor deviations.

2. **Correctness (30 points total)**
   - The motor speed settings in the `move` function are incorrect compared to the reference script. The reference uses `-math.pi` for straight movement, while the provided code uses `1`, which could lead to a significant change in simulation behavior.
   - The left and right turn speeds are also different, which could affect the robot's turning dynamics.
   - **Deductions**: 15 points for incorrect use of the PyChrono API that could lead to significant changes in simulation behavior.

3. **Code Quality (10 points total)**
   - The code is generally well-structured and readable. However, the comments could be more descriptive, especially in the `move` function.
   - The variable names are meaningful, but the lack of comments explaining the purpose of the `move` function and its parameters detracts from the overall quality.
   - **Deductions**: 5 points for insufficient comments.

4. **Efficiency (10 points total)**
   - The code does not contain unnecessary calculations or redundant code. However, the motor speed settings could be optimized for clarity and consistency with the reference.
   - **Deductions**: 3 points for missing obvious optimization opportunities.

5. **Error Handling and Robustness (5 points total)**
   - The error handling in the `move` function is adequate, raising a `ValueError` for invalid modes. The reference script does the same, so no deductions are necessary here.
   - **Deductions**: 0 points.

6. **Use of Visualization Tools (5 points total)**
   - The visualization setup is mostly correct, but the print statements could be considered a minor issue in terms of clarity and consistency with the reference.
   - **Deductions**: 2 points for minor visualization issues.

### Summary of Deductions
- Completeness: 5 points
- Correctness: 15 points
- Code Quality: 5 points
- Efficiency: 3 points
- Error Handling and Robustness: 0 points
- Use of Visualization Tools: 2 points

### Final Score Calculation
Starting from 100 points:
- 100 - 5 (Completeness) - 15 (Correctness) - 5 (Code Quality) - 3 (Efficiency) - 0 (Error Handling) - 2 (Visualization) = 70 points

Final Score: [[70]]

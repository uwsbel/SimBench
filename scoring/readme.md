- `clean_truth.py` is used to remove comments from the ground truth demos located in the `demo_data` folder. The cleaned Python files can then be used for similarity-based evaluation.

- `extractPy.py` is designed to remove comments and extract Python code from the outputs generated by S-LLMs.

- `evaluatePy.py` is responsible for compiling and running the Python scripts generated by S-LLMs.

- `p_sim_score.py` is a parallel implementation for calculating similarity-based baseline metrics, including the ROUGE family and CodeBLEU.

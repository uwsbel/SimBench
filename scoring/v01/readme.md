## Files associated with version 1 of the J-LLM

- `claude_generate_simulation.py`, `google_generate_simulation.py`, `gpt_generate_simulation.py`, `mistral_generate_simulation.py`, and `opensource_generate_simulation.py` are Python scripts used to generate Digital Twins (DTs) for specific LLMs. The `opensource_generate_simulation.py` script is designed for open-source LLMs, as mentioned in the paper.

- `openai_generate_simulation.py` is intended for general LLMs that support OpenAI-style API calls. Additionally, it supports vLLM for local LLM usage.

- `p_JLLM_score.py` is a parallelized implementation script for evaluating the code generated by S-LLMs. Please note that using this script can incur significant API costs in just a few seconds.

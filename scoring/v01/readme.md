Files associated with version 1 of the J-LLM.

claude_generate_simulation.py; google_generate_simulation.py; gpt_generate_simulation.py; mistral_generate_simulation.py; opensource_generate_simulation.py are the python scripts to generate DTs for specific LLMs. opensource_generate_simulation.py works for the open-source LLMs mentioned in the paper.

openai_geneate_simulation.py works for general LLMs that can fit openai style api calls. vLLM is also supported for local LLM usage.

p_JLLM_score.py is the parallel implementation python script for evaluating the code generated by S-LLMs. Please note that it will cost a lot of API cost in very few seconds.

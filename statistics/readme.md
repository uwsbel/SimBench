This folder contains CSV data recording the LLMs' performance on various metrics, as well as Python scripts for data analysis and visualization.

- The CSV files `evaluation_results.csv`, `filtered_pass_data.csv`, `pass.csv`, and `LLM.csv` contain all the evaluation scores across different metrics.

- The Python scripts `rank1.py`, `rank2.py`, `rank3.py`, `rank4.py`, `rank5.py`, and `analyze_csv.py` are used to extract metrics and ranks from the CSV files.

- The script `correlation.py` calculates the Spearman correlation between the metrics.
